## Installation & Usage

### 1. Install Dependencies

It is recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Launch from Command Line

After installation, simply run:

```bash
deepcode
```

This will launch the DeepCode platform with a premium terminal UI and full intelligent code services.

## Main Modules

- **deepcode_agent.py**  
  Main entry point, loads the UI and starts the multi-agent system.

- **Deepcode/agents/**  
  Agent definitions and workflow logic for various code-related tasks.

- **Deepcode/prompts/**  
  Prompt templates for all agents, easily extensible and customizable.

- **Deepcode/ui/logo.py**  
  Terminal startup logo and tagline, designed for elegance and impact.

- **deepcode_cli.py**  
  CLI entry point, enables `deepcode` one-command startup.
