  # CORE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
  implementation_steps:
    1. "Setup Pygame framework and basic window with game engine architecture"
    2. "Implement Snake class with movement, growth, and self-collision detection"
    3. "Create Food system with random generation and collision with snake"
    4. "Build score management system with SQLite database for high scores"
    5. "Develop UI screens (main menu, game screen, game over) with modern design"
    6. "Add game states, pause functionality, and smooth transitions"
    7. "Implement speed progression, visual effects, and polish features"
    8. "Testing, optimization, and PyInstaller packaging for distribution"
