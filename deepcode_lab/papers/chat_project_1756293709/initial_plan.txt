Based on your requirements for a Snake game with Python + Pygame, I'll create a comprehensive implementation plan with a pixel art style, scoring system, difficulty levels, and all the requested features.

```yaml
project_plan:
  title: "Pixel Art Snake Game"
  description: "A retro-style Snake game with beautiful pixel graphics, complete game logic, scoring system, difficulty levels, pause functionality, and high score tracking"
  project_type: "game"

  # CORE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
  implementation_steps:
    1. "Setup project structure and install Pygame, create basic window with pixel art styling and color palette"
    2. "Implement Snake class with movement, growth mechanics, and pixel-perfect rendering with retro visual effects"
    3. "Create food system with random generation, collision detection, and special food types for scoring variety"
    4. "Build game state manager with pause functionality, difficulty levels (speed adjustment), and game flow control"
    5. "Design menu system with main menu, game over screen, difficulty selection, and high score display"
    6. "Implement scoring system with points calculation, level progression, and persistent high score storage"
    7. "Add keyboard controls (arrow keys), game restart functionality, and smooth transitions between states"
    8. "Polish with pixel art effects, screen transitions, and comprehensive testing of all game features"

  # DEPENDENCIES & SETUP
  dependencies:
    required_packages:
      - "pygame>=2.5.0"
      - "json"  # Built-in for high score storage
    optional_packages:
      - "pygame-menu>=4.3.0: Enhanced menu system"
    setup_commands:
      - "python -m venv snake_env"
      - "source snake_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: snake_env\\Scripts\\activate"
      - "pip install -r requirements.txt"
      - "python main.py"

  # KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS
  tech_stack:
    language: "Python 3.8+"
    frameworks: ["Pygame"]
    key_libraries: ["pygame", "json", "random", "time"]

  main_features:
    - "Pixel art snake with smooth movement and growth animation"
    - "Multiple difficulty levels with progressive speed increase"
    - "Comprehensive scoring system with bonus points and level tracking"
    - "Pause/resume functionality with keyboard controls"
    - "Restart game feature without closing application"
    - "Persistent high score storage across game sessions"
    - "Beautiful pixel art UI with retro color scheme"
    - "Collision detection for walls, self-collision, and food consumption"
    - "Game state management (menu, playing, paused, game over)"
    - "Keyboard-only controls using arrow keys"
```

This implementation plan provides a complete roadmap for creating a polished Snake game that meets all your requirements. The modular structure ensures clean code organization, while the step-by-step implementation approach allows for iterative development and testing. The pixel art style will be achieved through careful color selection, blocky sprites, and retro visual effects using Pygame's drawing capabilities.
