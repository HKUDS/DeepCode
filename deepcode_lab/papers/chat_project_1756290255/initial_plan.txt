## 🎯 Key Implementation Details

### **Core Game Architecture**
- **Snake Class**: Manages body segments, movement direction, growth mechanics, and collision boundaries
- **Food System**: Handles random placement, different food types with varying scores, and visual animations
- **Game Engine**: Controls game states (menu, playing, paused, game over), manages timing, and coordinates all systems
- **Collision Detection**: Efficient algorithms for wall collision, self-collision, and food consumption

### **UI/UX Implementation**
- **Layered Interface**: Separate rendering layers for game objects, UI elements, and effects
- **State Management**: Clean transitions between menu, game, settings, and pause states
- **Responsive Design**: Automatic scaling for different screen resolutions
- **Animation System**: Smooth transitions, score popup effects, and visual feedback

### **Audio Integration**
- **Sound Manager**: Centralized audio control with volume management and audio channel separation
- **Dynamic Audio**: Context-aware sound effects that respond to game events
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient audio loading and memory management

### **Data Persistence**
- **Configuration System**: JSON-based settings storage with validation and default fallbacks
- **Score Tracking**: Persistent high score records with timestamp and statistics
- **Error Recovery**: Robust file handling with backup and recovery mechanisms

### **Performance Considerations**
- **60 FPS Target**: Optimized rendering pipeline with efficient sprite management
- **Memory Management**: Careful resource loading and cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- **Cross-Platform**: Tested compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux systems

This implementation plan provides a solid foundation for developing a professional-quality Snake game that meets all the specified requirements while maintaining clean, maintainable code architecture.
