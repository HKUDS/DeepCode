Its purpose is to anticipate future patterns, trends,\nand events in diverse facets of urban life, including transportation,\npopulation movement, and crime rates. Although numerous efforts\nhave been dedicated to developing neural network techniques for\naccurate predictions on spatio-temporal data, it is important to note\nthat many of these methods heavily depend on having sufficient\nlabeled data to generate precise spatio-temporal representations.\nUnfortunately, the issue of data scarcity is pervasive in practical\nurban sensing scenarios.

This has significant implications in the field\nof urban computing, where the ability to predict transportation\npatterns can optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance\noverall urban mobility [ 18,31]. Moreover, anticipating population\nmovement can aid in effective urban planning and resource alloca-\ntion [ 7,20]. Additionally, the ability to forecast crimes can greatly\ncontribute to enhancing public safety [ 32]. Spatio-temporal predic-\ntion plays a vital role in shaping smarter and more efficient cities,\nultimately leading to an improved quality of urban life.\nIt is important to highlight the various types of neural network\narchitectures commonly adopted in this domain of spatio-temporal\nprediction. These architectures are designed to capture and model\nthe complex relationships between spatial and temporal dimensions\nin the data. One widely employed architecture is the Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) [ 15,39,45], which is effective in extract-\ning spatial features by applying convolutional filters across the\ninput data. Another line of spatio-temporal neural networks is the\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) family [ 1,34,43]. Those spatio-\ntemporal RNNs are well-suited for capturing temporal dependencies\nby maintaining a memory state that can retain information over\ntime. Recently, there has been a surge in the use of Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) for spatio-temporal prediction [ 36,40,47]. GNNs\nexcel in modeling complex spatial relationships in data represented\nas graphs, where each node corresponds to a spatial location and\nedges capture the connections between them.\nWhile current spatio-temporal neural network techniques have\nproven to be highly effective, it is crucial to acknowledge their\nstrong dependence on having an abundance of labeled data in order\nto generate accurate predictions. However, the pervasive problem\nof data scarcity in practical urban sensing scenarios poses a sig-\nnificant challenge. For example, deploying sensors throughout the\nentire urban space to monitor citywide traffic volume or air qual-\nity is impractical due to the high cost involved [ 17,41]. Moreover,\nthe challenge of limited labeled data availability extends to spatio-\ntemporal forecasting across different cities, in which acquiring\nlabeled data for each target city becomes a daunting task [ 13,38].\nThese issues emphasize the pressing need for novel solutions that\naddress data scarcity and enhance the generalization capabilities of\nspatio-temporal models in various smart city applications.\nInspired by the remarkable progress of large language models\n(LLMs), our primary goal is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that\npossesses outstanding generalization capabilities across a wide\narray of urban tasks. Leveraging the reasoning abilities inherent in\nLLMs, we aim to expand their success into the domain of spatio-\ntemporal analysis. Our objective is to develop a model that can\neffectively comprehend and forecast intricate spatial and temporal\npatterns, enabling it to excel in various urban scenarios.\nWhile it is of utmost importance to develop a versatile spatio-\ntemporal model capable of effectively handling diverse downstreamarXiv:2403.00813v3  [cs.CL]  19 May 2024\n\n## Page 2\n\nInstruction s:Given thehistorical data fortaxiflow over 12time steps inaspecific region ofNew York City, the\nrecorded taxiinflows are[9194100 939376676650695542],and therecorded taxioutflows are[9691108\n10283787674106938657]\u2026Please predict thetaxiinflow and outflow fornext 12time steps\u2026\nLabel s:Taxi Inflow :[5536333033273714167512]Taxi Outflow :[547069593231292120111312].\nOurs :Based onthegiven information, thepredictions oftaxiinflow and outflow inthisregion are\u2026\nPrediction :Inflow :[514845424038332824211816]Outflow :[544945413835302521181614].\nHuman\nInstructions\nLLAMA -70BGround true\nPrediction :Inflow :[282827262524232323232424]Outflow :[343128252219171616151515] Baseline\nLLM :There isanoticeable spike intaxiinflows and outflows around 10:00-11:00,which may indicate asurge in\ndemand fortaxiservices\u2026Ihave created apredictive model toforecast thetaxiflow forthenext 12time steps :\nPrediction :Inflow :[53586460677378849196102 108]Outflow :[5661687379848995102 107 113 119]\nUrbanGPT\n2 4 6 8 10 12\nTime Steps020406080100 Inflow Predicted valueBaseline\nLLM\nOurs\nGround_true\n2 4 6 8 10 12\nTime Steps020406080100120 Outflow Predicted valueBaseline\nLLM\nOurs\nGround_trueFigure 1: The superior predictive performance of the pro-\nposed UrbanGPT compared to the large language model\n(LLaMA-70B) and the spatiotemporal graph neural network\n(STGCN) in a zero-shot traffic flow prediction scenario.\ntasks, aligning the spatio-temporal context with the knowledge\nspace of large language models (LLMs) and enabling them to com-\nprehend the complex dependencies across time and space present\nsignificant challenges. These hurdles call for meticulous model\ndesign to bridge the gap between the unique characteristics of\nspatio-temporal data and the knowledge encoded within LLMs.\nContributions . In light of these challenges, we propose UrbanGPT,\na large language model specifically tailored for spatio-temporal\nprediction. At the core of UrbanGPT lies a novel spatio-temporal\ninstruction-tuning paradigm that seeks to align the intricate de-\npendencies of time and space, with the knowledge space of LLMs.\nWithin our UrbanGPT framework, we start by incorporating a\nspatio-temporal dependency encoder, which utilizes a multi-level\ntemporal convolutional network. This encoder enables the model\nto capture the intricate temporal dynamics present in the spatio-\ntemporal data across various time resolutions. Then, our model\ninvolves aligning textual and spatio-temporal information to em-\npower language models in effectively injecting spatio-temporal\ncontextual signals. This is achieved through the utilization of a\nlightweight alignment module that projects the representations\nof spatio-temporal dependencies. The result is the generation of\nmore expressive semantic representations by integrating valuable\ninformation from both textual and spatio-temporal domains.\nThrough the incorporation of spatio-temporal information dur-\ning the instruction-tuning process, the language model gains profi-\nciency in understanding and processing the intricate relationships\nand patterns found in spatio-temporal data. By leveraging the in-\nsights obtained from the spatio-temporal domain, the language\nmodel becomes better equipped to capture the nuances and com-\nplexities of spatio-temporal phenomena. This, in turn, enables the\nmodel to make more reliable and insightful predictions across vari-\nous urban scenarios, even when faced with limited data availability.\nTo showcase the superior predictive performance of our pro-\nposed model, we compare it with the large language model (LLaMA-\n70B) and the spatio-temporal graph neural network (STGCN) in azero-shot traffic flow prediction scenario guided by textual instruc-\ntions, as depicted in Figure 1. The large language model, LLaMA,\neffectively infers traffic patterns from the input text. However, its\nlimitations in handling numeric time-series data with complex spa-\ntial and temporal dependencies can sometimes lead to opposite\ntraffic trend predictions. On the other hand, the pre-trained base-\nline model demonstrates a strong understanding of spatio-temporal\ndependencies. However, it may suffer from overfitting to the source\ndataset and underperform in zero-shot scenarios, indicating its lim-\nited generalization capabilities beyond existing spatio-temporal\nprediction models. In contrast, our proposed model achieves a har-\nmonious integration of domain-specific spatio-temporal knowledge\nand language modeling capabilities. This enables us to make more\naccurate and reliable predictions under data scarcity.\nIn summary, our main contributions can be outlined as follows:\n\u2022To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop\na spatio-temporal large language model capable of predicting\ndiverse urban phenomena across different datasets, especially\nunder conditions of limited data availability.\n\u2022We propose UrbanGPT, a spatio-temporal prediction framework\nthat empowers large language models (LLMs) to comprehend\nthe intricate inter-dependencies across time and space. This is\nachieved through the seamless integration of a spatio-temporal\ndependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm, ef-\nfectively aligning the spatio-temporal context with LLMs.\n\u2022Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets\nprovide compelling evidence of our proposed UrbanGPT\u2019s excep-\ntional ability to generalize in zero-shot spatio-temporal learning\nscenarios. These findings highlight the model\u2019s robust general-\nization capacity, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately\npredicting and understanding spatio-temporal patterns, even in\nscenarios where no prior training data is available.\n2 PRELIMINARIES\nSpatio-Temporal Data . Spatio-temporal data is commonly col-\nlected and can be represented as a three-dimensional tensor X\u2208\nR\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc47\u00d7\ud835\udc39. Each element X\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udc53in the tensor corresponds to the value\nof the\ud835\udc53-th feature at the \ud835\udc61-th time interval in the \ud835\udc5f-th region. To\nprovide an example, let\u2019s consider predicting taxi traffic patterns in\nan urban area. In this scenario, the data can represent the inflow\nand outflow of taxis in a specific region ( e.g., the\ud835\udc5f-th spatial area)\nduring a given time period from \ud835\udc61to\ud835\udc61\u22121(e.g., a 30-minute interval).\nSpatio-Temporal Forecasting. In spatio-temporal prediction tasks,\na common scenario involves forecasting future trends using histor-\nical data. Specifically, the goal is to predict the data for the next \ud835\udc43\ntime steps based on information from the preceding \ud835\udc3bsteps.\nX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+\ud835\udc43=\ud835\udc53(X\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e\u2212\ud835\udc3b+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e) (1)\nThe function \ud835\udc53(\u00b7)represents a spatio-temporal prediction model\nthat has been trained effectively using historical data. Spatio-temporal\nprediction tasks can be divided into two main categories: regression\nprediction, which involves predicting continuous values like traffic\nflow or taxi demand [ 22], and classification prediction, where the\ngoal is to classify events such as crime occurrence prediction [ 11].\nTo optimize the model \ud835\udc53(\u00b7), different loss functions are utilized\n\n## Page 3\n\nbased on the specific characteristics of the spatio-temporal scenar-\nios.\nSpatio-Temporal Zero-Shot Learning . Despite the effectiveness\nof current spatio-temporal learning approaches, they often en-\ncounter difficulties in effectively generalizing across a wide range of\ndownstream spatio-temporal learning scenarios. In this study, our\nfocus is on addressing the challenge of spatio-temporal zero-shot\nscenarios, where we aim to learn from previously unseen data in\ndownstream spatio-temporal prediction datasets or tasks. This can\nbe formally defined as follows:\n\u02dcX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+\ud835\udc43=\u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u02dcX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e\u2212\ud835\udc3b+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e) (2)\nIn this particular scenario, the prediction function \u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u00b7)is responsi-\nble for forecasting the spatio-temporal data \u02dcXfrom downstream\ntasks that have not been previously encountered. It should be noted\nthat the model \u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u00b7)is not trained specifically on the target data.\n3 METHODOLOGY\n3.1 Spatio-Temporal Dependency Encoder\nAlthough large language models demonstrate exceptional profi-\nciency in language processing, they face challenges in comprehend-\ning the time-evolving patterns inherent in spatio-temporal data. To\novercome this limitation, we propose enhancing the capability of\nlarge language models to capture temporal dependencies within\nspatio-temporal contexts. This is accomplished by integrating a\nspatio-temporal encoder that incorporates a multi-level tempo-\nral convolutional network. By doing so, we enable the model to\neffectively capture the intricate temporal dependencies across vari-\nous time resolutions, thereby improving its understanding of the\ncomplex temporal dynamics present in the spatio-temporal data.\nSpecifically, our spatio-temporal encoder is composed of two key\ncomponents: a gated dilated convolution layer and a multi-level\ncorrelation injection layer. Let\u2019s formalize this architecture as:\n\u03a8(\ud835\udc59)\n\ud835\udc5f=(\u00afW(\ud835\udc59)\n\ud835\udc58\u2217E(\ud835\udc59)\n\ud835\udc5f+\u00afb(\ud835\udc59)\n\ud835\udc58)\u00b7\ud835\udeff(\u00afW(\ud835\udc59)\n\ud835\udc54\u2217E(\ud835\udc59)\n\ud835\udc5f+\u00afb(\ud835\udc59)\n\ud835\udc54)+E\u2032(\ud835\udc59)\n\ud835\udc5f (3)\nWe begin with the initial spatio-temporal embedding, denoted as\nE\ud835\udc5f\u2208R\ud835\udc47\u00d7\ud835\udc51. This embedding is obtained by enhancing the original\ndata Xthrough a linear layer. To address the issue of gradient\nvanishing, we utilize a slice of E\ud835\udc5f, denoted as E\u2032\n\ud835\udc5f\u2208R\ud835\udc47\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51, which\nis determined by the size of the dilated convolutional kernel. This\nslice is employed for performing residual operations. To perform\nthe residual operations, we use 1-D dilated convolution kernels\n\u00afW\ud835\udc58and \u00afW\ud835\udc54\u2208R\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc54\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61, along with the corresponding bias\nterms \u00afb\ud835\udc58and \u00afb\ud835\udc54\u2208R\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61. The sigmoid activation function \ud835\udeffis\napplied to control the degree of information preservation during the\nrepeated convolution operation. After the gated temporal dilated\nconvolutional layer encoding, we are able to effectively capture the\ntemporal dependencies across multiple time steps, resulting in the\ngeneration of temporal representations.\nThese representations contain different levels of temporal de-\npendencies, reflecting various granularity-aware time-evolving pat-\nterns. To preserve these informative patterns, we introduce a multi-\nlevel correlation injection layer. This layer is designed to incorpo-\nrate correlations between different levels and is formalized as:\nS(\ud835\udc59)\n\ud835\udc5f=(W(\ud835\udc59)\n\ud835\udc60\u2217\u03a8(\ud835\udc59)\n\ud835\udc5f+b(\ud835\udc59)\n\ud835\udc60)+S(\ud835\udc59\u22121)\n\ud835\udc5f (4)We have the convolution kernel W\ud835\udc60\u2208R\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc46\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\u00d7\ud835\udc51\u2032\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61and the bias\nvector b\ud835\udc60\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61. These are employed after \ud835\udc3flayers of encoding.\nA simple non-linear layer is employed to merge the results from\nequations 3 and 4, and the final spatio-temporal dependency repre-\nsentations of are denoted as \u02dc\u03a8\u2208R\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc39\u00d7\ud835\udc51. To address the diverse\nset of urban scenarios that may arise downstream, our proposed\nspatio-temporal encoder is designed to be independent of graph\nstructures when modeling spatial correlations. This is particularly\ncrucial because in zero-shot prediction contexts, the spatial rela-\ntionships between entities may be unknown or difficult to ascertain.\nBy not relying on explicit graph structures, our encoder can effec-\ntively handle a broad spectrum of urban scenarios, where spatial\ncorrelations and dependencies can vary or be challenging to define\nin advance. This flexibility enables our model to adapt and perform\nwell, ensuring its applicability in a wide range of urban contexts.\n3.2 Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning\n3.2.1 Spatio-Temporal-Text Alignment. In order to enable lan-\nguage models to effectively comprehend spatio-temporal patterns,\nit is crucial to align textual and spatio-temporal information. This\nalignment allows for the fusion of different modalities, resulting\nin a more informative representation. By integrating contextual\nfeatures from both textual and spatio-temporal domains, we can\ncapture complementary information and extract higher-level se-\nmantic representations that are more expressive and meaningful.\nTo achieve this objective, we utilize a lightweight alignment mod-\nule to project the spatio-temporal dependencies representations\n\u02dc\u03a8. This projection involves the use of parameters W\ud835\udc5d\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f\nandb\ud835\udc5d\u2208R\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, where\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3frepresents the commonly used hidden\ndimension in language models (LLMs).\nThe resulting projection, denoted as H\u2208R\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc39\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, are rep-\nresented in the instructions using special tokens as: <ST_start>,\n<ST_HIS>, ..., <ST_HIS>, <ST_end>. Here, <ST_start> and <ST_end>\nserve as identifiers marking the beginning and end of the spatio-\ntemporal token. These identifiers can be included in the large-\nscale language model by expanding its vocabulary. The placeholder\n<ST_HIS> represents the spatio-temporal token and corresponds to\nthe projection Hin the hidden layer. By employing this technique,\nthe model gains the ability to discern spatio-temporal dependen-\ncies, thereby enhancing its proficiency in successfully performing\nspatio-temporal predictive tasks within urban scenes.\n3.2.2 Spatio-Temporal Prompt Instructions. In scenarios in-\nvolving spatio-temporal prediction, both temporal and spatial in-\nformation contain valuable semantic details that contribute to the\nmodel\u2019s understanding of spatio-temporal patterns within specific\ncontexts. For instance, traffic flow in the early morning differs sig-\nnificantly from rush hour, and there are variations in traffic patterns\nbetween commercial and residential areas. As a result, we recognize\nthe potential of representing both temporal and spatial information\nas prompt instruction text. We leverage the text understanding\ncapabilities of large language models to encode this information,\nenabling associative reasoning for downstream tasks.\nIn our UrbanGPT framework, we integrate multi-granularity\ntime information and spatial details as instruction inputs for the\nlarge language model. Time information includes factors such as\n\n## Page 4\n\nl = 1l = 2l = 3\nGateSpatio -Temporal dependenc yencoder\nLLMs spaceLightweight alignment moduleSpatio -Temporal Instruction -Tuning\nGiven the historical data and the corresponding tokens\n<ST_HIS> fortaxi flow \u2026The recording time \u2026This region\nislocated \u2026Please generate thepredictive tokens for\u2026\nBased onthe given information, the predictive tokens\noftaxi inflow and outflow inthis region are<ST_PRE> \u2026\nLarge Language Models\nInflow\uff1a[28 26 20 33 49  50 48 34 40 22 \u2026]\nOutflow\uff1a[40 52 58 32 22 10 18 19 20 24\u2026]City A\nCity B\n\u2026\nInstruction -Tuning Zero -shot prediction\n<ST_HIS> <ST_HIS> Multi -tasks\nRegression Layer<ST_HIS> <ST_ PRE> \ntokens\nText Replacement\nLlama VicunaAlignment\nRegressionST Encoder\nTask assignment\nText instructionsInstructions\nResponsesRegion A\nRegion B\nFrozen Trainable\n\u2026\nSpatio -Temporal Zero -shot prediction\nTrain city\nTest cityTrain region\nTest region\nST dependency representations ST Instruction -Tuning of LLMsFigure 2: The overall architecture of the proposed spatio-temporal language model UrbanGPT.\nTemporal Information :The recording time ofthehistorical data is'January 7,2020 ,08:30,\nTuesday toJanuary 7,2020 ,14:00,Tuesday, with data points recorded at30-minute intervals' .\nSpatial Information :Here istheregion information :This region islocated within theStaten\nIsland borough district and encompasses various POIs within athree -kilometer radius,\ncovering Public Safety, Education Facility, Residential categories .\nTask description :Now wewant topredict thetaxi inflow and outflow forthenext 12time\nsteps during thetime period of'January 7,2020 ,14:30,Tuesday toJanuary 7,2020 ,20:00,\nTuesday, with data points recorded at30-minute intervals' .\nFigure 3: Illustration of spatio-temporal prompt instructions\nencoding the time- and location-aware information.\nthe day of the week and the hour of the day, while regional in-\nformation encompasses the city, administrative areas, and nearby\npoints of interest (POI) data, among others. By incorporating these\ndiverse elements, UrbanGPT is capable of identifying and assimi-\nlating spatio-temporal patterns across different regions and time-\nframes. This enables the model to encapsulate these insights within\ncomplex spatio-temporal contexts, thereby enhancing its ability\nfor zero-shot reasoning. The design of the instructional text for\nspatio-temporal information is illustrated in Figure 3.\n3.2.3 Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning of LLMs. When\nit comes to incorporating detailed spatio-temporal textual descrip-\ntions, the next stage is to fine-tune large language models (LLMs)\nusing instructions to generate spatio-temporal forecasts in textual\nformat. However, this approach poses two challenges. Firstly , spatio-\ntemporal forecasting typically relies on numerical data, which dif-\nfers in structure and patterns from natural language that language\nmodels excel at processing, focusing on semantic and syntactic rela-\ntionships. Secondly , large language models are typically pre-trained\nusing a multi-classification loss to predict vocabulary, resulting in a\nprobability distribution of potential outcomes. This contrasts with\nthe continuous value distribution required for regression tasks.\nTo address these challenges, UrbanGPT adopts a different strat-\negy by refraining from directly predicting future spatio-temporal\nvalues. Instead, it generates forecasting tokens that aid in the pre-\ndiction process. These tokens are subsequently passed through a\nregression layer, which maps the hidden representations to generate\nmore accurate predictive values. The formulation of the regressionlayer in our spatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm is:\n\u02c6Y\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53=W3[\ud835\udf0e(W1H\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53),\ud835\udf0e(W2\u0393\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53)] (5)\nThe prediction result, denoted as \u02c6Y\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53\u2208R\ud835\udc43, is obtained using the\nrectified linear unit activation function, represented by \ud835\udf0e. The hid-\nden representations of the forecasting tokens, denoted as \u0393\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53\u2208\nR\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, are introduced as a novel term in the vocabulary of large lan-\nguage models (LLMs). The regression layer is formulated using\nweight matrices W1\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f,W2\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, and W3\u2208R\ud835\udc43\u00d72\ud835\udc51\u2032\n,\nwhere[\u00b7,\u00b7]represents the concatenation operation. While the prob-\nability distribution of the forecasting tokens remains relatively\nstable, their hidden representations contain rich spatio-temporal\ncontextual attributes that capture dynamic spatio-temporal interde-\npendencies. This enables our model to provide precise predictions\nby leveraging this contextual information.\n3.3 Model Optimization\nBuilding upon the baseline model [ 1,8], we adopt the absolute error\nloss as our regression loss function. This choice allows us to effec-\ntively handle predictions across a wide range of urban scenarios.\nAdditionally, we introduce a classification loss as a joint loss to\ncater to diverse task requirements. To ensure optimal performance,\nour model optimizes different losses based on the specific task in-\nputs. For instance, we utilize the regression loss for tasks such as\ntraffic flow prediction, while employing the classification loss for\ntasks like crime prediction. This approach enables our model to\neffectively address the unique challenges posed by each task and\ndeliver accurate predictions in various urban scenarios.\nL\ud835\udc50=\u22121\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc56=1[\ud835\udeff(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)\u00b7log(\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)+(1\u2212\ud835\udeff(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56))\u00b7log(1\u2212\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)]\nL\ud835\udc5f=1\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc56=1|\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\u2212\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56|;L=L\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc60+L\ud835\udc5f+L\ud835\udc50 (6)\nHere,\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56represents a sample from \u02c6Y, and\ud835\udc41represents the total\nnumber of samples, which is calculated as the product of \ud835\udc45,\ud835\udc47, and\n\ud835\udc39. We use various loss functions in our model, including L\ud835\udc50for\n\n## Page 5\n\nbinary cross-entropy loss, L\ud835\udc5ffor regression loss, and the cross-\nentropy loss adopted in our spatio-temporal language models. To\ncapture probability distributions from the prediction, we employ\nthe sigmoid function denoted by \ud835\udeff. Each of these loss functions\nplays a specific role in our model, allowing us to effectively handle\nclassification, regression, and language modeling tasks as needed.\n4 EVALUATION\nIn this section, we aim to assess the capabilities of our proposed\nmodel across various settings by addressing five key questions:\n\u2022RQ1 : What is the performance and generalization capability of\nUrbanGPT in diverse zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction tasks?\n\u2022RQ2 : How does UrbanGPT perform when compared to existing\nspatio-temporal models in classical supervised scenarios?\n\u2022RQ3 : What specific contributions do the proposed key compo-\nnents bring to enhance the capabilities of our UrbanGPT model?\n\u2022RQ4 : Can the proposed model robustly handle the forecasting\nscenarios with varying spatio-temporal patterns?\n4.1 Experimental Setting\n4.1.1 Dataset Description. To evaluate the effectiveness of the\nproposed model in predicting spatio-temporal patterns across var-\nious urban computing scenarios, we conducted experiments us-\ning four distinct datasets: NYC-taxi, NYC-bike, NYC-crime, and\nCHI-taxi. These datasets encompass a wide range of data sources\nto capture the dynamic nature of urban environments, including\nrecords of taxi travel, bike trajectories, crime incidents in New York\nCity, and taxi travel data in Chicago. To facilitate our analysis, we\npartitioned the cities into grid-like regions based on latitude and\nlongitude information. Within specific time intervals, we aggre-\ngated statistical measures for each region. For example, this in-\nvolved calculating the number of taxi inflows and outflows within\na 30-minute period in region A, or determining the count of theft\nincidents within a day in region B. Furthermore, Points of Interest\n(POIs) data can be obtained through APIs provided by map services,\nutilizing the latitude and longitude of different regions. For more\ncomprehensive data descriptions, please refer to the Appendix.\n4.1.2 Evaluation Protocols. In order to investigate the capabili-\nties of large language models in analyzing diverse spatio-temporal\ndata across different regions, we selected a subset of taxi, bike, and\ncrime data from various areas of New York City as our training set.\n\u2022Zero-Shot Learning Scenarios . We assessed the model perfor-\nmance by predicting future spatio-temporal data from regions in\nNYC or even Chicago that were unseen in the training phase.\n\u2022Supervised Learning Scenarios . We evaluated the model using\nfuture data from the same regions as the training set.\nFor regression tasks, we maintained a consistent training and test-\ning methodology across all baseline models. When it came to classi-\nfication tasks involving crime data, we utilized binary cross-entropy\nas the loss function for training and testing the models. Our ex-\nperiments were conducted using the robust vicuna-7b [ 50] as the\nfoundational large language model for UrbanGPT. For a more com-\nprehensive understanding of our methodology and experimental\nsetup, please refer to the appendix for detailed information.4.1.3 Evaluation Metrics. For regression tasks, we employed\nMAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)\nas evaluation metrics. These metrics quantify the discrepancies\nbetween the predicted outcomes and the actual labels, with lower\nvalues indicating superior performance [ 12,49]. In the case of clas-\nsification tasks, we utilized Recall and Macro-F1 as evaluation met-\nrics to assess performance. Recall measures the model\u2019s ability to\ncorrectly identify positive instances, while Macro-F1 is a compre-\nhensive performance metric that combines precision and recall to\nprovide an overall measure of classification accuracy [11, 30].\n4.1.4 Baseline Model. We conducted a thorough comparison\nwith 10 advanced models to establish baselines for our proposed\nmethod. (i)In the category of RNNs-based spatio-temporal forecast-\ning methods, we compared our proposed method with AGCRN [ 1],\nDMVSTNET [ 39] and ST-LSTM [ 33]. These approaches leverage\nRNNs for modeling and prediction. (ii)The GNNs-based spatio-\ntemporal models primarily utilize graph neural networks to cap-\nture spatial correlations and integrate temporal encoders to capture\nspatio-temporal relationships. The models we compared against\nin this category include GWN [ 37], MTGNN [ 36], STSGCN [ 26],\nTGCN [ 47], and STGCN [ 42].(iii) In the attention-based spatio-\ntemporal models category, the methods employ attention mecha-\nnisms to model spatio-temporal correlations. The models we com-\npared against in this category are ASTGCN [8] and STWA [5].\n4.2 Zero-Shot Prediction Performance (RQ1)\nIn this section, we thoroughly evaluate the predictive performance\nof our proposed model in zero-shot scenarios. The results of our\nevaluation are presented in Table 1 and visualized in Figure 4. Our\nobjective is to assess the model\u2019s effectiveness in predicting spatio-\ntemporal patterns in geographical areas that it has not encountered\nduring training. This evaluation encompasses both cross-region\nand cross-city settings, allowing us to gain insights into the model\u2019s\ngeneralization capabilities across different locations.\n4.2.1 Prediction on Unseen Regions within a City. Cross-\nregion scenarios entail using data from certain regions within a\ncity to forecast future conditions in other regions that have not\nbeen encountered by the model. Through a thorough analysis of\nthe model\u2019s performance in these cross-region predictions, we can\ndraw attention to three significant observations:\ni) Superior Zero-shot Predictive Performance . The results pre-\nsented in Table 1 highlight the exceptional performance of our\nproposed model in both regression and classification tasks on vari-\nous datasets, surpassing the baseline models in zero-shot prediction.\nThe success of our model can be attributed to two key factors.\n\u2022Spatio-Temporal-Text-Alignment . The alignment of spatio-\ntemporal contextual signals with the text comprehension abil-\nities of language models plays a pivotal role in the success of\nour proposed model. This fusion enables the model to effectively\ncapitalize on both the encoded urban dynamics from the spa-\ntiotemporal signals and the comprehensive understanding of\ntextual context provided by the LLMs. By leveraging these two\nessential aspects, our model achieves the remarkable ability to\ngeneralize its prediction capabilities in zero-shot scenarios.\n\n## Page 6\n\nTable 1: Our model\u2019s performance in zero-shot prediction is evaluated on three diverse datasets: NYC-taxi, NYC-bike, and\nNYC-crime, providing a comprehensive assessment of its predictive capabilities in unseen situations.\nModelDataset NYC-taxi NYC-bike NYC-crime\nType Inflow Outflow Inflow Outflow Burglary Robbery\nMetrics MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE Macro-F1 Recall Macro-F1 Recall\nAGCRN 10.86 26.51 13.15 36.45 3.41 7.98 3.42 8.08 0.48 0.00 0.49 0.01\nASTGCN 9.75 24.12 12.42 33.28 5.58 11.58 5.78 12.29 0.49 0.01 0.55 0.09\nGWN 10.73 26.50 9.67 26.74 3.32 8.17 3.07 7.52 0.48 0.00 0.52 0.04\nMTGNN 10.16 25.84 12.59 35.38 3.18 7.62 3.20 7.65 0.64 0.27 0.65 0.30\nSTWA 11.28 28.97 13.54 38.61 4.59 10.94 4.35 10.67 0.48 0.00 0.51 0.03\nSTSGCN 18.97 41.38 20.07 45.79 6.85 14.98 6.54 14.77 0.48 0.00 0.48 0.00\nSTGCN 12.54 30.80 14.32 39.58 4.11 9.21 4.45 9.62 0.48 0.00 0.64 0.30\nTGCN 10.04 25.10 10.98 30.03 2.88 6.55 2.91 6.42 0.56 0.10 0.58 0.13\nDMVSTNET 11.00 28.29 10.59 29.20 3.80 9.87 3.65 9.21 0.48 0.01 0.59 0.15\nST-LSTM 16.97 34.43 18.93 44.10 7.78 15.41 6.92 17.12 0.48 0.00 0.49 0.03\nUrbanGPT 6.16 16.92 6.83 21.78 2.02 5.16 2.01 5.03 0.67 0.34 0.69 0.42\n\u2022Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning . This adaptive tuning\nprocess empowers the LLM to effectively integrate crucial in-\nformation from the instructions, enhancing its comprehension\nof the complex relationships and dependencies between spatial\nand temporal factors. By seamlessly merging the spatio-temporal\ninstruction-tuning with the spatio-temporal dependency encoder,\nour proposed model, UrbanGPT, successfully preserves universal\nand transferable spatio-temporal knowledge. Consequently, the\nmodel becomes capable of capturing the fundamental patterns\nand dynamics that govern spatio-temporal phenomena, enabling\nit to make precise predictions in downstream zero-shot scenarios.\nii) Enhanced Urban Semantic Understanding . Urban seman-\ntics offer valuable insights into the diverse dimensions of spatial\nand temporal characteristics. Our approach involves training our\nmodel on a wide range of datasets, enriching its understanding\nof spatio-temporal dynamics across different timeframes and geo-\ngraphical locations. In contrast, baseline models tend to prioritize\nencoding temporal and spatial dependencies, neglecting the nu-\nanced semantics that differentiate regions, timeframes, and data\ncategories. By incorporating comprehensive semantic awareness\ninto our UrbanGPT, we significantly enhance its ability to make\naccurate zero-shot predictions in previously unseen regions.\niii) Improved Performance in Sparse Data Scenarios . Predict-\ning spatio-temporal patterns in sparse data environments is chal-\nlenging as models tend to overfit when data points are scarce. This\nchallenge is particularly notable when predicting crimes, where data\nis often sparse but crucial for accurate predictions. Baseline mod-\nels struggle in cross-regional prediction tasks under these sparse\nconditions, resulting in low recall scores that indicate potential over-\nfitting. To overcome this limitation, our model integrates spatio-\ntemporal learning with large language models (LLMs) using an\neffective spatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm. By incorpo-\nrating rich semantic insights, our approach enhances the model\u2019s\nspatio-temporal representations, enabling it to effectively handle\nsparse data and achieve improved prediction accuracy.\n4.2.2 Cross-City Prediction Task. To assess the performance of\nour model in cross-city prediction tasks, we conducted tests on the\nCHI-taxi dataset, which was not seen during the training phase. The\nresults, depicted in Figure 4, yielded the following observations:\u2022Consistency in Multi-step Prediction : Our model consistently\noutperforms the comparison method at each time step. Notably,\nit maintains a significant advantage in both short-term and long-\nterm spatio-temporal prediction, demonstrating the robustness\nof our proposed model in cross-city prediction scenarios.\n\u2022Effective Knowledge Transfer Across Cities : The prediction\nresults obtained from the CHI-taxi dataset validate the supe-\nrior forecasting capabilities of our model in cross-city scenarios.\nThis enhancement can be attributed to the integration of spatio-\ntemporal encoders with the spatio-temporal instruction-tuning\nparadigm. By incorporating these components, our model ef-\nfectively captures universal and transferable spatio-temporal\npatterns, allowing it to make accurate predictions. Additionally,\nby considering different geographical information and temporal\nfactors alongside the learned transferred knowledge, our model\nsuccessfully associates spatio-temporal patterns exhibited by\nsimilar functional areas and historical periods. This comprehen-\nsive understanding provides valuable insights for making precise\nzero-shot predictions in cross-city scenarios.\n4.3 Classical Supervised Prediction Task (RQ2)\nThis section examines the predictive capabilities of our UrbanGPT\nin end-to-end supervised prediction scenarios, as presented in Ta-\nble 2. We will discuss the results from two perspectives below.\nEnhanced Long-Term Forecasting Abilities : We examined the\nmodel\u2019s effectiveness in long-term spatio-temporal forecasting by\nutilizing test datasets that spanned broader time intervals. For in-\nstance, we trained the model using data from 2017 and evaluated its\nperformance on data from 2021. The results of these experiments\ndemonstrate that our UrbanGPT possesses a significant advantage\nover the baselines, highlighting its superior ability to generalize\nacross different temporal landscapes. This capability reduces the\nneed for frequent retraining or incremental updates, making the\nmodel more aligned with real-world applications. Additionally, the\nexperiments have confirmed that incorporating additional textual\nknowledge does not hinder model performance or introduce noise,\nthus further validating the feasibility of utilizing large language\nmodels to enhance spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.\nSpatial Semantic Understanding : Accurately capturing spatial\ncorrelations is crucial in the realm of spatio-temporal prediction.\n\n## Page 7\n\n123456789101112\nHorizon23456 MAE on CHI-taxi\nAGCRN\nASTGCN\nTGCN\nMTGNNSTWA\nSTGCN\nDMVSTNET\nOurs\n123456789101112\nHorizon3456789101112131415 RMSE on CHI-taxi\nAGCRN\nASTGCN\nTGCN\nMTGNNSTWA\nSTGCN\nDMVSTNET\nOurs\n123456789101112\nHorizon12345 MAE on CHI-taxi\nAGCRN\nASTGCN\nTGCN\nMTGNNSTWA\nSTGCN\nDMVSTNET\nOurs\n123456789101112\nHorizon456789101112131415 RMSE on CHI-taxi\nAGCRN\nASTGCN\nTGCN\nMTGNNSTWA\nSTGCN\nDMVSTNET\nOursFigure 4: Time step-based prediction comparison experiment conducted on the CHI-taxi dataset.\nTable 2: Evaluation of performance in the end-to-end super-\nvised setting on the NYC-taxi and NYC-bike datasets.\nModelNYC-taxi NYC-bike\nInflow Outflow Inflow Outflow\nMAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE\nAGCRN 2.83 8.35 2.62 9.21 3.30 7.65 3.38 7.73\nASTGCN 5.41 18.04 5.00 19.29 3.87 7.93 3.66 7.69\nGWN 3.91 11.93 2.89 10.85 4.30 9.04 3.88 8.29\nMTGNN 3.09 10.13 2.61 10.96 3.31 7.47 3.26 7.61\nSTWA 3.90 12.64 3.15 11.32 4.23 9.07 4.18 9.18\nSTSGCN 4.57 13.93 4.41 15.87 5.10 12.23 4.72 10.78\nSTGCN 3.45 9.82 3.17 10.53 3.88 9.23 3.90 9.08\nTGCN 3.99 11.47 3.31 11.58 4.12 7.92 4.11 7.84\nDMVSTNET 3.83 11.55 2.76 9.88 3.71 7.95 3.69 7.92\nST-LSTM 7.78 15.41 6.92 17.12 5.00 11.52 4.96 11.41\nUrbanGPT 2.50 6.78 1.71 6.68 3.11 7.10 3.01 6.94\nTraditional methods often employ graph networks or attention\nmechanisms to analyze these correlations.

This approach enables the model to comprehend the\nshared characteristics of areas with similar functions at a higher\nsemantic level. Consequently, it deduces patterns of correlation\nbetween various functional zones and effectively represents the\ninterconnections among different regions.\n4.4 Ablation study (RQ3)\nThis section investigates the impact of different key components\non the performance of our model, as illustrated in Figure 5. Our\nrigorous testing primarily revolves around the zero-shot scenario\nusing the NYC-taxi dataset. Through our analysis, we have distilled\nthe benefits offered by the different modules into four key points.\n\u2022(1) Impact of Spatial and Temporal Context :-STC . By re-\nmoving time and spatial information from the instruction text,\nwe observed a noticeable decline in the model\u2019s performance.\nThis can be attributed to the lack of temporal information, forcing\nthe model to rely solely on spatio-temporal encoders for encoding\ntime-related features and performing prediction tasks. Furthermore,\nthe absence of spatial information hindered the model\u2019s ability to\ncapture spatial correlations, making it challenging to analyze the\ndistinct spatio-temporal patterns of different areas.\n\u2022(2) Impact of Instruction-Tuning with Diverse Datasets :-\nMulti . We conducted our training solely on the NYC-taxi data to\nexamine whether incorporating multiple datasets would provide\nvaluable insights to the LLMs in zero-shot scenarios.\n-STC -Multi -STE Ours -T2P\nNYC-taxi inflow6.06.26.46.66.87.0 MAE\nNYC-taxi inflow16.817.217.618.0 RMSE\nNYC-taxi outflow6.66.87.07.27.47.67.88.0 MAE\nNYC-taxi outflow21.522.022.523.023.524.024.5 RMSEFigure 5: Ablation study of our proposed UrbanGPT.\nHowever, this restricted training approach limited the model\u2019s\nability to fully uncover the spatio-temporal dynamics of cities due to\nthe absence of diverse urban indicators. As a result, the model\u2019s per-\nformance was suboptimal. By integrating diverse spatio-temporal\ndata from multiple sources, our model can effectively capture the\nunique characteristics of different geographical locations and their\nevolving spatio-temporal patterns.\n\u2022(3) Impact of Spatio-Temporal Encoder :-STE . In this vari-\nant, we disable the spatio-temporal encoder to investigate its\neffect on aligning the large language model with encoded urban\ndependency dynamics into latent embedding space.\nThe results clearly indicate that the absence of the spatio-temporal\nencoder significantly hampers the performance of the large lan-\nguage model in spatio-temporal prediction scenarios. This under-\nscores the crucial role played by the proposed spatio-temporal\nencoder in enhancing the model\u2019s predictive capabilities.\n\u2022(4) Regression Layer Incorporation in Instruction-Tuning:\nT2P. We explicitly instructed UrbanGPT to generate its predic-\ntions in a textual format. However, the suboptimal performance\nindicates the challenges in utilizing LLMs for precise numerical\nregression tasks, as opposed to employing regression layers.\nThe primary challenge stems from the model\u2019s dependence on\nmulti-class loss for optimization during training, leading to a mis-\nmatch between the model\u2019s probabilistic output and the continuous\nvalue distribution necessary for spatio-temporal forecasting. To\nbridge this gap, we incorporated a regression predictor into our\nmodel, significantly improving its capacity to generate more precise\nnumerical predictions for regression tasks.\n4.5 Model Robustness Study (RQ4)\nIn this section, we focus on evaluating the robustness of our Ur-\nbanGPT across different spatio-temporal pattern scenarios. We cate-\ngorize regions based on the magnitude of numerical variations, such\nas taxi flow, during a specific time period. Lower variance indicates\nstable temporal patterns, while higher variance suggests diverse\nspatio-temporal patterns in active commercial zones or densely\npopulated areas. Our findings, shown in Figure 6, reveal that most\n\n## Page 8\n\nSTGCN AGCRN GWN STWA MTGNN Ours\n[0-0.25] (0.25-0.5] (0.5-0.75] (0.75-1.0]0.00.51.01.52.02.53.0 [0.0, 0.75]\n16182022242628\n(0.75, 1.0]NYC-taxi inflow RMSE\n[0-0.25] (0.25-0.5] (0.5-0.75] (0.75-1.0]0.00.51.01.52.0 [0.0, 0.75]\n2022242628303234363840\n(0.75, 1.0]NYC-taxi outflow RMSE\n[0-0.25] (0.25-0.5] (0.5-0.75] (0.75-1.0]0.000.250.500.751.001.251.501.752.00 [0.0, 0.75]\n56789101112\n(0.75, 1.0]CHI-taxi inflow RMSE\n[0-0.25] (0.25-0.5] (0.5-0.75] (0.75-1.0]0.00.51.01.52.02.5 [0.0, 0.75]\n5678910111213\n(0.75, 1.0]CHI-taxi outflow RMSEFigure 6: Robustness study of the UrbanGPT model.\nmodels perform well in regions with lower variance, where patterns\nremain relatively stable. However, the baseline model struggles in\nregions with high variance, particularly within the (0.75, 1.0] range,\nresulting in inaccurate predictions. This limitation may stem from\nthe baseline model\u2019s difficulty in inferring spatio-temporal patterns\nin unseen regions during zero-shot scenarios. In practical applica-\ntions, accurate prediction of densely populated or bustling areas\nis crucial for urban governance, such as traffic light control and\nsecurity scheduling. Our UrbanGPT demonstrates significant per-\nformance improvement in the (0.75, 1.0] interval, highlighting its\npowerful zero-shot prediction capability with our method.\n4.6 Case Study\nIn our case study, we thoroughly evaluate several large language\nmodels (LLMs) for zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction. We em-\nphasize the challenges these models face in directly understanding\nspatio-temporal patterns from numeric geo-series data. In con-\ntrast, we showcase the exceptional performance of our proposed\nUrbanGPT framework in capturing universal spatio-temporal pat-\nterns and its ability to generalize effectively across various zero-shot\nspatio-temporal forecasting scenarios. For a more comprehensive\nunderstanding, please refer to the Appendix.\n5 RELATED WORK\nDeep Spatio-temporal Prediction Models . Deep spatio-temporal\nprediction methods have gained prominence in deep learning due\nto their impressive performance. These models typically consist of\ntwo components: temporal dependency modeling and spatial corre-\nlation encoding. Early models like D-LSTM [ 43] and ST-resnet [ 45]\nused RNNs and convolutional networks to model temporal and\nspatial dependencies. Graph neural networks (GNNs) proved to\nbe a natural fit for spatial correlation modeling, as seen in models\nlike STGCN [ 42] and DCRNN [ 14], which utilized graph structures\nbased on node distances. Techniques such as learnable region-wise\ngraph structures [ 36,37] and dynamic spatio-temporal graph net-\nworks [9, 48] have further enhanced spatial correlation modeling.\nFurthermore, researchers have explored approaches such as\nmulti-scale temporal learning [ 34] and multi-granularity tempo-\nral learning [ 8] to encode temporal dependencies. These strategies\nenable the capture of features like long-term and short-term correla-\ntions as well as periodicity. These advancements have significantlycontributed to the progress of spatio-temporal prediction. However,\nit is worth noting that the majority of these studies are tailored\nfor supervised contexts, with limited research and development\nfocused on zero-shot spatio-temporal forecasting. This represents\nan important area that requires further exploration.\nSpatio-Temporal Pre-training . Spatio-temporal pre-training tech-\nniques have recently received significant research attention. These\ntechniques primarily focus on generative [ 16,24] and contrastive [ 46]\npre-training models to enhance the predictive performance of down-\nstream tasks. There has also been extensive exploration of pretrain-\nfinetune frameworks for few-shot learning scenarios [ 13,19], aim-\ning to improve knowledge transferability by aligning source and\ntarget data. However, these approaches require training or fine-\ntuning on target data and lack zero-shot prediction capabilities. In\nthis work, we address the challenge of data scarcity in downstream\nurban scenarios by proposing UrbanGPT. Our model demonstrates\nthe ability to generalize well across various scenarios, mitigating\nthe need for extensive training or fine-tuning on target data.\nLarge Language Models. The emergence of large language mod-\nels [3,21] has recently attracted significant attention due to their\nunprecedented machine performance in tasks like text understand-\ning and reasoning. These models have become a hot topic, demon-\nstrating the potential to advance from intelligent algorithms to\nartificial intelligence. Open-source large language models such as\nLlama [ 28,29], Vicuna [ 50], and ChatGLM [ 44] have been released,\nleading to researchers exploring their application in various fields\nto enhance transfer learning capabilities with domain knowledge\nfrom these models. In the computer vision domain, researchers\nhave combined multimodal large language models with prompt\nlearning methods to achieve zero-shot predictions in downstream\ntasks [ 25,51,52]. Furthermore, the capabilities of LLMs in graph\nreasoning [ 2,4,27], recommendation [ 10,23,35] and traffic anal-\nysis [ 6] have been extensively studied. However, the utilization\nof large language models for zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction\ntasks in the field of urban intelligence remains largely unexplored.\n6 CONCLUSION\nWe present the UrbanGPT, a spatio-temporal large language model,\nto generalize well in diverse urban scenarios. To seamlessly align\nthe spatio-temporal contextual signals with LLMs, we introduce a\nspatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm. This empowers the\nUrbanGPT with the remarkable ability to learn universal and trans-\nferable spatio-temporal patterns across various types of urban data.\nThrough extensive experiments and meticulous ablation studies,\nwe demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of the UrbanGPT\u2019s\narchitecture and its key components. However, it is important to\nacknowledge that while the results are promising, there are still\nlimitations to be addressed in future studies. As a first step, we are\nactively engaged in collecting a more diverse range of urban data\nto enhance and refine the capabilities of our UrbanGPT across a\nbroader spectrum of urban computing domains. Additionally, un-\nderstanding the decision-making process of our UrbanGPT is of im-\nportance. While the model demonstrates exceptional performance,\nproviding interpretability and explainability is equally essential.\nFuture research efforts will focus on empowering our model with\nthe ability to interpret and explain its predictions.\n\n## Page 9\n\nREFERENCES\n[1]Lei Bai, Lina Yao, Can Li, Xianzhi Wang, and Can Wang. 2020.

This includes detailed dataset informa-\ntion, hyperparameter configuration, experimental setting for the\ninstruction-tuning phase and test phase, as well as the baselines.\nFurthermore, we present a case study of our UrbanGPT, showcasing\nits effectiveness for zero-shot spatio-temporal predictions.\nA.1 Experimental Details Description\nA.1.1 Dataset Details. We collected data on taxi flows, bicycle\nflows, and crime incidents in New York City for training and evalu-\nation. The NYC-taxi dataset contains 263 regions, with each region\nmeasuring approximately 3km x 3km. The time sampling inter-\nval for this dataset is 30 minutes. The NYC-bike and NYC-crime\ndatasets consist of 2162 regions, each represented by a 1km x 1km\ngrid. The time sampling interval for NYC-bike is also 30 minutes,\nwhile for NYC-crime, it is 1 day. All datasets cover the time period\nfrom Jan 1, 2016, to Dec 31, 2021, in NYC. The CHI-taxi dataset\nincludes 77 regions, with each region measuring approximately\n4km x 4km. This dataset includes all taxi data from January 1, 2021,\nto December 31, 2021, with a time sampling interval of 30 minutes.\nA.1.2 Hyperparameters Settings. The parameters for the di-\nlation convolution kernel in the time encoder are set as follows:\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b,\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61, and\ud835\udc51\u2032\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61are all set to 32, with a dilation factor of 1. For\nour prediction task, we aim to predict the next 12 steps of data\nbased on the previous 12 steps. Both the history length ( \ud835\udc3b) and\nprediction length ( \ud835\udc43) are set to 12. The projection layer parameters\nare configured with \ud835\udc51set to 64 and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3fset to 4096. Lastly, the hidden\nlayer parameter \ud835\udc51\u2032for the regression layer is set to 128.\nA.1.3 Further Experimental Setup Descriptions. During the\ninstruction-tuning phase, we randomly selected 80 regions from\nthe three datasets in New York City as training data. It\u2019s important\nto note that the region indices were kept consistent for the NYC-\nbike and NYC-crime datasets. The training sets had specific time\nintervals: for NYC-taxi datasets, it ranged from January 1, 2017,\nto March 31, 2017; for NYC-bike datasets, it covered April 1, 2017,\nto June 30, 2017; and for NYC-crime datasets, it spanned from\nJanuary 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018. For the pretraining of the\nspatio-temporal dependency encoder and the baseline models, we\nutilized the same data for training to optimize the parameters. The\nmaximum epoch count was set at 100. In the testing phase, we\nconducted the following evaluations:\n\u2022(i)Zero-Shot Prediction . We also selected an additional 80\nregions from the New York City datasets as unseen test data. For\nthe NYC-bike and NYC-taxi datasets, we used the first two weeks\nof data in 2020 for testing. As for the NYC-crime dataset, we used\nthe entire year of 2020 for testing. In the case of the Chicago city\ndataset, we evaluated the model using all the data from Dec 2021.\n\u2022(ii)Classical Supervised Prediction : For evaluation purposes,\nwe chose the data with the longest time interval, which involved\ntesting the model using all the data from the NYC-bike and NYC-\ntaxi datasets specifically for the month of December 2021.\nA.1.4 Baseline Details. To facilitate our discussion, we have\ncategorized all the baselines into three distinct categories: RNN-\nbased models, attention-based models, and graph neural network(GNN)-based spatio-temporal prediction models.

The instructions pro-\nvided to the models are clearly indicated in blue font. The results\ndemonstrate that various LLMs are capable of generating predic-\ntions based on these instructions, thereby highlighting the effective-\nness of the prompt design. For instance, ChatGPT relies on historical\naverages rather than explicitly incorporating temporal or spatial\ndata in its predictions. Llama-2-70b analyzes specific time periods\nand regions, but it encounters challenges in encoding numerical\ntime-series dependencies, resulting in suboptimal predictive perfor-\nmance. On the other hand, Claude-2.1 effectively summarizes and\nanalyzes historical data, leveraging peak-hour patterns and points\nof interest to achieve more accurate traffic trend predictions.\nOur proposed UrbanGPT seamlessly integrates spatio-temporal\ncontextual signals with the reasoning capabilities of large language\nmodels (LLMs) through a spatio-temporal instruction-tuning para-\ndigm. This integration leads to remarkable improvements in predict-\ning numerical values and spatio-temporal trends. These findings\nunderscore the potential and effectiveness of our framework in\ncapturing universal spatio-temporal patterns, making zero-shot\nspatio-temporal prediction practical and achievable.\n\n## Page 11\n\nTable 3: We examine the zero-shot predictions of different LLMs for bicycle flow in NYC with the provided instructions.\nInstructions: Given the historical data for bike flow over 12 time steps in a specific region of New York City, the recorded bike inflows\nare [12 8 9 15 10 12 14 9 6 12 25 20], and the recorded bike outflows are [5 12 12 15 10 11 6 9 4 6 10 15].

This has significant implications in the field\\nof urban computing, where the ability to predict transportation\\npatterns can optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance\\noverall urban mobility [ 18,31]. Moreover, anticipating population\\nmovement can aid in effective urban planning and resource alloca-\\ntion [ 7,20]. Additionally, the ability to forecast crimes can greatly\\ncontribute to enhancing public safety [ 32]. Spatio-temporal predic-\\ntion plays a vital role in shaping smarter and more efficient cities,\\nultimately leading to an improved quality of urban life.\\nIt is important to highlight the various types of neural network\\narchitectures commonly adopted in this domain of spatio-temporal\\nprediction. These architectures are designed to capture and model\\nthe complex relationships between spatial and temporal dimensions\\nin the data. One widely employed architecture is the Convolutional\\nNeural Network (CNN) [ 15,39,45], which is effective in extract-\\ning spatial features by applying convolutional filters across the\\ninput data. Another line of spatio-temporal neural networks is the\\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) family [ 1,34,43]. Those spatio-\\ntemporal RNNs are well-suited for capturing temporal dependencies\\nby maintaining a memory state that can retain information over\\ntime. Recently, there has been a surge in the use of Graph Neural\\nNetworks (GNNs) for spatio-temporal prediction [ 36,40,47]. GNNs\\nexcel in modeling complex spatial relationships in data represented\\nas graphs, where each node corresponds to a spatial location and\\nedges capture the connections between them.\\nWhile current spatio-temporal neural network techniques have\\nproven to be highly effective, it is crucial to acknowledge their\\nstrong dependence on having an abundance of labeled data in order\\nto generate accurate predictions. However, the pervasive problem\\nof data scarcity in practical urban sensing scenarios poses a sig-\\nnificant challenge. For example, deploying sensors throughout the\\nentire urban space to monitor citywide traffic volume or air qual-\\nity is impractical due to the high cost involved [ 17,41]. Moreover,\\nthe challenge of limited labeled data availability extends to spatio-\\ntemporal forecasting across different cities, in which acquiring\\nlabeled data for each target city becomes a daunting task [ 13,38].\\nThese issues emphasize the pressing need for novel solutions that\\naddress data scarcity and enhance the generalization capabilities of\\nspatio-temporal models in various smart city applications.\\nInspired by the remarkable progress of large language models\\n(LLMs), our primary goal is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that\\npossesses outstanding generalization capabilities across a wide\\narray of urban tasks. Leveraging the reasoning abilities inherent in\\nLLMs, we aim to expand their success into the domain of spatio-\\ntemporal analysis. Our objective is to develop a model that can\\neffectively comprehend and forecast intricate spatial and temporal\\npatterns, enabling it to excel in various urban scenarios.\\nWhile it is of utmost importance to develop a versatile spatio-\\ntemporal model capable of effectively handling diverse downstreamarXiv:2403.00813v3  [cs.CL]  19 May 2024\\n\\n## Page 2\\n\\nInstruction s:Given thehistorical data fortaxiflow over 12time steps inaspecific region ofNew York City, the\\nrecorded taxiinflows are[9194100 939376676650695542],and therecorded taxioutflows are[9691108\\n10283787674106938657]\u2026Please predict thetaxiinflow and outflow fornext 12time steps\u2026\\nLabel s:Taxi Inflow :[5536333033273714167512]Taxi Outflow :[547069593231292120111312].\\nOurs :Based onthegiven information, thepredictions oftaxiinflow and outflow inthisregion are\u2026\\nPrediction :Inflow :[514845424038332824211816]Outflow :[544945413835302521181614].\\nHuman\\nInstructions\\nLLAMA -70BGround true\\nPrediction :Inflow :[282827262524232323232424]Outflow :[343128252219171616151515] Baseline\\nLLM :There isanoticeable spike intaxiinflows and outflows around 10:00-11:00,which may indicate asurge in\\ndemand fortaxiservices\u2026Ihave created apredictive model toforecast thetaxiflow forthenext 12time steps :\\nPrediction :Inflow :[53586460677378849196102 108]Outflow :[5661687379848995102 107 113 119]\\nUrbanGPT\\n2 4 6 8 10 12\\nTime Steps020406080100 Inflow Predicted valueBaseline\\nLLM\\nOurs\\nGround_true\\n2 4 6 8 10 12\\nTime Steps020406080100120 Outflow Predicted valueBaseline\\nLLM\\nOurs\\nGround_trueFigure 1: The superior predictive performance of the pro-\\nposed UrbanGPT compared to the large language model\\n(LLaMA-70B) and the spatiotemporal graph neural network\\n(STGCN) in a zero-shot traffic flow prediction scenario.\\ntasks, aligning the spatio-temporal context with the knowledge\\nspace of large language models (LLMs) and enabling them to com-\\nprehend the complex dependencies across time and space present\\nsignificant challenges. These hurdles call for meticulous model\\ndesign to bridge the gap between the unique characteristics of\\nspatio-temporal data and the knowledge encoded within LLMs.\\nContributions . In light of these challenges, we propose UrbanGPT,\\na large language model specifically tailored for spatio-temporal\\nprediction. At the core of UrbanGPT lies a novel spatio-temporal\\ninstruction-tuning paradigm that seeks to align the intricate de-\\npendencies of time and space, with the knowledge space of LLMs.\\nWithin our UrbanGPT framework, we start by incorporating a\\nspatio-temporal dependency encoder, which utilizes a multi-level\\ntemporal convolutional network. This encoder enables the model\\nto capture the intricate temporal dynamics present in the spatio-\\ntemporal data across various time resolutions. Then, our model\\ninvolves aligning textual and spatio-temporal information to em-\\npower language models in effectively injecting spatio-temporal\\ncontextual signals. This is achieved through the utilization of a\\nlightweight alignment module that projects the representations\\nof spatio-temporal dependencies. The result is the generation of\\nmore expressive semantic representations by integrating valuable\\ninformation from both textual and spatio-temporal domains.\\nThrough the incorporation of spatio-temporal information dur-\\ning the instruction-tuning process, the language model gains profi-\\nciency in understanding and processing the intricate relationships\\nand patterns found in spatio-temporal data. By leveraging the in-\\nsights obtained from the spatio-temporal domain, the language\\nmodel becomes better equipped to capture the nuances and com-\\nplexities of spatio-temporal phenomena. This, in turn, enables the\\nmodel to make more reliable and insightful predictions across vari-\\nous urban scenarios, even when faced with limited data availability.\\nTo showcase the superior predictive performance of our pro-\\nposed model, we compare it with the large language model (LLaMA-\\n70B) and the spatio-temporal graph neural network (STGCN) in azero-shot traffic flow prediction scenario guided by textual instruc-\\ntions, as depicted in Figure 1. The large language model, LLaMA,\\neffectively infers traffic patterns from the input text. However, its\\nlimitations in handling numeric time-series data with complex spa-\\ntial and temporal dependencies can sometimes lead to opposite\\ntraffic trend predictions. On the other hand, the pre-trained base-\\nline model demonstrates a strong understanding of spatio-temporal\\ndependencies. However, it may suffer from overfitting to the source\\ndataset and underperform in zero-shot scenarios, indicating its lim-\\nited generalization capabilities beyond existing spatio-temporal\\nprediction models. In contrast, our proposed model achieves a har-\\nmonious integration of domain-specific spatio-temporal knowledge\\nand language modeling capabilities. This enables us to make more\\naccurate and reliable predictions under data scarcity.\\nIn summary, our main contributions can be outlined as follows:\\n\u2022To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop\\na spatio-temporal large language model capable of predicting\\ndiverse urban phenomena across different datasets, especially\\nunder conditions of limited data availability.\\n\u2022We propose UrbanGPT, a spatio-temporal prediction framework\\nthat empowers large language models (LLMs) to comprehend\\nthe intricate inter-dependencies across time and space. This is\\nachieved through the seamless integration of a spatio-temporal\\ndependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm, ef-\\nfectively aligning the spatio-temporal context with LLMs.\\n\u2022Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets\\nprovide compelling evidence of our proposed UrbanGPT\u2019s excep-\\ntional ability to generalize in zero-shot spatio-temporal learning\\nscenarios. These findings highlight the model\u2019s robust general-\\nization capacity, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately\\npredicting and understanding spatio-temporal patterns, even in\\nscenarios where no prior training data is available.\\n2 PRELIMINARIES\\nSpatio-Temporal Data .

In spatio-temporal prediction tasks,\\na common scenario involves forecasting future trends using histor-\\nical data. Specifically, the goal is to predict the data for the next \ud835\udc43\\ntime steps based on information from the preceding \ud835\udc3bsteps.\\nX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+\ud835\udc43=\ud835\udc53(X\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e\u2212\ud835\udc3b+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e) (1)\\nThe function \ud835\udc53(\u00b7)represents a spatio-temporal prediction model\\nthat has been trained effectively using historical data. Spatio-temporal\\nprediction tasks can be divided into two main categories: regression\\nprediction, which involves predicting continuous values like traffic\\nflow or taxi demand [ 22], and classification prediction, where the\\ngoal is to classify events such as crime occurrence prediction [ 11].\\nTo optimize the model \ud835\udc53(\u00b7), different loss functions are utilized\\n\\n## Page 3\\n\\nbased on the specific characteristics of the spatio-temporal scenar-\\nios.\\nSpatio-Temporal Zero-Shot Learning . Despite the effectiveness\\nof current spatio-temporal learning approaches, they often en-\\ncounter difficulties in effectively generalizing across a wide range of\\ndownstream spatio-temporal learning scenarios. In this study, our\\nfocus is on addressing the challenge of spatio-temporal zero-shot\\nscenarios, where we aim to learn from previously unseen data in\\ndownstream spatio-temporal prediction datasets or tasks. This can\\nbe formally defined as follows:\\n\u02dcX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+\ud835\udc43=\u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u02dcX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e\u2212\ud835\udc3b+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e) (2)\\nIn this particular scenario, the prediction function \u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u00b7)is responsi-\\nble for forecasting the spatio-temporal data \u02dcXfrom downstream\\ntasks that have not been previously encountered. It should be noted\\nthat the model \u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u00b7)is not trained specifically on the target data.\\n3 METHODOLOGY\\n3.1 Spatio-Temporal Dependency Encoder\\nAlthough large language models demonstrate exceptional profi-\\nciency in language processing, they face challenges in comprehend-\\ning the time-evolving patterns inherent in spatio-temporal data. To\\novercome this limitation, we propose enhancing the capability of\\nlarge language models to capture temporal dependencies within\\nspatio-temporal contexts. This is accomplished by integrating a\\nspatio-temporal encoder that incorporates a multi-level tempo-\\nral convolutional network. By doing so, we enable the model to\\neffectively capture the intricate temporal dependencies across vari-\\nous time resolutions, thereby improving its understanding of the\\ncomplex temporal dynamics present in the spatio-temporal data.\\nSpecifically, our spatio-temporal encoder is composed of two key\\ncomponents: a gated dilated convolution layer and a multi-level\\ncorrelation injection layer. Let\u2019s formalize this architecture as:\\n\u03a8(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f=(\u00afW(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc58\u2217E(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+\u00afb(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc58)\u00b7\ud835\udeff(\u00afW(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc54\u2217E(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+\u00afb(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc54)+E\u2032(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f (3)\\nWe begin with the initial spatio-temporal embedding, denoted as\\nE\ud835\udc5f\u2208R\ud835\udc47\u00d7\ud835\udc51. This embedding is obtained by enhancing the original\\ndata Xthrough a linear layer. To address the issue of gradient\\nvanishing, we utilize a slice of E\ud835\udc5f, denoted as E\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5f\u2208R\ud835\udc47\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51, which\\nis determined by the size of the dilated convolutional kernel. This\\nslice is employed for performing residual operations. To perform\\nthe residual operations, we use 1-D dilated convolution kernels\\n\u00afW\ud835\udc58and \u00afW\ud835\udc54\u2208R\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc54\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61, along with the corresponding bias\\nterms \u00afb\ud835\udc58and \u00afb\ud835\udc54\u2208R\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61. The sigmoid activation function \ud835\udeffis\\napplied to control the degree of information preservation during the\\nrepeated convolution operation. After the gated temporal dilated\\nconvolutional layer encoding, we are able to effectively capture the\\ntemporal dependencies across multiple time steps, resulting in the\\ngeneration of temporal representations.\\nThese representations contain different levels of temporal de-\\npendencies, reflecting various granularity-aware time-evolving pat-\\nterns. To preserve these informative patterns, we introduce a multi-\\nlevel correlation injection layer. This layer is designed to incorpo-\\nrate correlations between different levels and is formalized as:\\nS(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f=(W(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc60\u2217\u03a8(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+b(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc60)+S(\ud835\udc59\u22121)\\n\ud835\udc5f (4)We have the convolution kernel W\ud835\udc60\u2208R\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc46\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\u00d7\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61and the bias\\nvector b\ud835\udc60\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61. These are employed after \ud835\udc3flayers of encoding.\\nA simple non-linear layer is employed to merge the results from\\nequations 3 and 4, and the final spatio-temporal dependency repre-\\nsentations of are denoted as \u02dc\u03a8\u2208R\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc39\u00d7\ud835\udc51. To address the diverse\\nset of urban scenarios that may arise downstream, our proposed\\nspatio-temporal encoder is designed to be independent of graph\\nstructures when modeling spatial correlations. This is particularly\\ncrucial because in zero-shot prediction contexts, the spatial rela-\\ntionships between entities may be unknown or difficult to ascertain.\\nBy not relying on explicit graph structures, our encoder can effec-\\ntively handle a broad spectrum of urban scenarios, where spatial\\ncorrelations and dependencies can vary or be challenging to define\\nin advance. This flexibility enables our model to adapt and perform\\nwell, ensuring its applicability in a wide range of urban contexts.\\n3.2 Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning\\n3.2.1 Spatio-Temporal-Text Alignment. In order to enable lan-\\nguage models to effectively comprehend spatio-temporal patterns,\\nit is crucial to align textual and spatio-temporal information. This\\nalignment allows for the fusion of different modalities, resulting\\nin a more informative representation. By integrating contextual\\nfeatures from both textual and spatio-temporal domains, we can\\ncapture complementary information and extract higher-level se-\\nmantic representations that are more expressive and meaningful.\\nTo achieve this objective, we utilize a lightweight alignment mod-\\nule to project the spatio-temporal dependencies representations\\n\u02dc\u03a8. This projection involves the use of parameters W\ud835\udc5d\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f\\nandb\ud835\udc5d\u2208R\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, where\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3frepresents the commonly used hidden\\ndimension in language models (LLMs).\\nThe resulting projection, denoted as H\u2208R\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc39\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, are rep-\\nresented in the instructions using special tokens as: <ST_start>,\\n<ST_HIS>, ..., <ST_HIS>, <ST_end>. Here, <ST_start> and <ST_end>\\nserve as identifiers marking the beginning and end of the spatio-\\ntemporal token. These identifiers can be included in the large-\\nscale language model by expanding its vocabulary. The placeholder\\n<ST_HIS> represents the spatio-temporal token and corresponds to\\nthe projection Hin the hidden layer. By employing this technique,\\nthe model gains the ability to discern spatio-temporal dependen-\\ncies, thereby enhancing its proficiency in successfully performing\\nspatio-temporal predictive tasks within urban scenes.\\n3.2.2 Spatio-Temporal Prompt Instructions. In scenarios in-\\nvolving spatio-temporal prediction, both temporal and spatial in-\\nformation contain valuable semantic details that contribute to the\\nmodel\u2019s understanding of spatio-temporal patterns within specific\\ncontexts. For instance, traffic flow in the early morning differs sig-\\nnificantly from rush hour, and there are variations in traffic patterns\\nbetween commercial and residential areas. As a result, we recognize\\nthe potential of representing both temporal and spatial information\\nas prompt instruction text. We leverage the text understanding\\ncapabilities of large language models to encode this information,\\nenabling associative reasoning for downstream tasks.\\nIn our UrbanGPT framework, we integrate multi-granularity\\ntime information and spatial details as instruction inputs for the\\nlarge language model. Time information includes factors such as\\n\\n## Page 4\\n\\nl = 1l = 2l = 3\\nGateSpatio -Temporal dependenc yencoder\\nLLMs spaceLightweight alignment moduleSpatio -Temporal Instruction -Tuning\\nGiven the historical data and the corresponding tokens\\n<ST_HIS> fortaxi flow \u2026The recording time \u2026This region\\nislocated \u2026Please generate thepredictive tokens for\u2026\\nBased onthe given information, the predictive tokens\\noftaxi inflow and outflow inthis region are<ST_PRE> \u2026\\nLarge Language Models\\nInflow\uff1a[28 26 20 33 49  50 48 34 40 22 \u2026]\\nOutflow\uff1a[40 52 58 32 22 10 18 19 20 24\u2026]City A\\nCity B\\n\u2026\\nInstruction -Tuning Zero -shot prediction\\n<ST_HIS> <ST_HIS> Multi -tasks\\nRegression Layer<ST_HIS> <ST_ PRE> \\ntokens\\nText Replacement\\nLlama VicunaAlignment\\nRegressionST Encoder\\nTask assignment\\nText instructionsInstructions\\nResponsesRegion A\\nRegion B\\nFrozen Trainable\\n\u2026\\nSpatio -Temporal Zero -shot prediction\\nTrain city\\nTest cityTrain region\\nTest region\\nST dependency representations ST Instruction -Tuning of LLMsFigure 2: The overall architecture of the proposed spatio-temporal language model UrbanGPT.\\nTemporal Information :The recording time ofthehistorical data is'January 7,2020 ,08:30,\\nTuesday toJanuary 7,2020 ,14:00,Tuesday, with data points recorded at30-minute intervals' .\\nSpatial Information :Here istheregion information :This region islocated within theStaten\\nIsland borough district and encompasses various POIs within athree -kilometer radius,\\ncovering Public Safety, Education Facility, Residential categories .\\nTask description :Now wewant topredict thetaxi inflow and outflow forthenext 12time\\nsteps during thetime period of'January 7,2020 ,14:30,Tuesday toJanuary 7,2020 ,20:00,\\nTuesday, with data points recorded at30-minute intervals' .\\nFigure 3: Illustration of spatio-temporal prompt instructions\\nencoding the time- and location-aware information.\\nthe day of the week and the hour of the day, while regional in-\\nformation encompasses the city, administrative areas, and nearby\\npoints of interest (POI) data, among others. By incorporating these\\ndiverse elements, UrbanGPT is capable of identifying and assimi-\\nlating spatio-temporal patterns across different regions and time-\\nframes. This enables the model to encapsulate these insights within\\ncomplex spatio-temporal contexts, thereby enhancing its ability\\nfor zero-shot reasoning. The design of the instructional text for\\nspatio-temporal information is illustrated in Figure 3.\\n3.2.3 Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning of LLMs. When\\nit comes to incorporating detailed spatio-temporal textual descrip-\\ntions, the next stage is to fine-tune large language models (LLMs)\\nusing instructions to generate spatio-temporal forecasts in textual\\nformat. However, this approach poses two challenges. Firstly , spatio-\\ntemporal forecasting typically relies on numerical data, which dif-\\nfers in structure and patterns from natural language that language\\nmodels excel at processing, focusing on semantic and syntactic rela-\\ntionships. Secondly , large language models are typically pre-trained\\nusing a multi-classification loss to predict vocabulary, resulting in a\\nprobability distribution of potential outcomes. This contrasts with\\nthe continuous value distribution required for regression tasks.\\nTo address these challenges, UrbanGPT adopts a different strat-\\negy by refraining from directly predicting future spatio-temporal\\nvalues. Instead, it generates forecasting tokens that aid in the pre-\\ndiction process. These tokens are subsequently passed through a\\nregression layer, which maps the hidden representations to generate\\nmore accurate predictive values. The formulation of the regressionlayer in our spatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm is:\\n\u02c6Y\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53=W3[\ud835\udf0e(W1H\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53),\ud835\udf0e(W2\u0393\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53)] (5)\\nThe prediction result, denoted as \u02c6Y\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53\u2208R\ud835\udc43, is obtained using the\\nrectified linear unit activation function, represented by \ud835\udf0e. The hid-\\nden representations of the forecasting tokens, denoted as \u0393\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53\u2208\\nR\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, are introduced as a novel term in the vocabulary of large lan-\\nguage models (LLMs). The regression layer is formulated using\\nweight matrices W1\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f,W2\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, and W3\u2208R\ud835\udc43\u00d72\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n,\\nwhere[\u00b7,\u00b7]represents the concatenation operation. While the prob-\\nability distribution of the forecasting tokens remains relatively\\nstable, their hidden representations contain rich spatio-temporal\\ncontextual attributes that capture dynamic spatio-temporal interde-\\npendencies. This enables our model to provide precise predictions\\nby leveraging this contextual information.\\n3.3 Model Optimization\\nBuilding upon the baseline model [ 1,8], we adopt the absolute error\\nloss as our regression loss function. This choice allows us to effec-\\ntively handle predictions across a wide range of urban scenarios.\\nAdditionally, we introduce a classification loss as a joint loss to\\ncater to diverse task requirements. To ensure optimal performance,\\nour model optimizes different losses based on the specific task in-\\nputs. For instance, we utilize the regression loss for tasks such as\\ntraffic flow prediction, while employing the classification loss for\\ntasks like crime prediction. This approach enables our model to\\neffectively address the unique challenges posed by each task and\\ndeliver accurate predictions in various urban scenarios.\\nL\ud835\udc50=\u22121\\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01\\n\ud835\udc56=1[\ud835\udeff(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)\u00b7log(\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)+(1\u2212\ud835\udeff(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56))\u00b7log(1\u2212\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)]\\nL\ud835\udc5f=1\\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01\\n\ud835\udc56=1|\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\u2212\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56|;L=L\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc60+L\ud835\udc5f+L\ud835\udc50 (6)\\nHere,\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56represents a sample from \u02c6Y, and\ud835\udc41represents the total\\nnumber of samples, which is calculated as the product of \ud835\udc45,\ud835\udc47, and\\n\ud835\udc39. We use various loss functions in our model, including L\ud835\udc50for\\n\\n## Page 5\\n\\nbinary cross-entropy loss, L\ud835\udc5ffor regression loss, and the cross-\\nentropy loss adopted in our spatio-temporal language models. To\\ncapture probability distributions from the prediction, we employ\\nthe sigmoid function denoted by \ud835\udeff. Each of these loss functions\\nplays a specific role in our model, allowing us to effectively handle\\nclassification, regression, and language modeling tasks as needed.\\n4 EVALUATION\\nIn this section, we aim to assess the capabilities of our proposed\\nmodel across various settings by addressing five key questions:\\n\u2022RQ1 : What is the performance and generalization capability of\\nUrbanGPT in diverse zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction tasks?\\n\u2022RQ2 : How does UrbanGPT perform when compared to existing\\nspatio-temporal models in classical supervised scenarios?\\n\u2022RQ3 : What specific contributions do the proposed key compo-\\nnents bring to enhance the capabilities of our UrbanGPT model?\\n\u2022RQ4 : Can the proposed model robustly handle the forecasting\\nscenarios with varying spatio-temporal patterns?\\n4.1 Experimental Setting\\n4.1.1 Dataset Description. To evaluate the effectiveness of the\\nproposed model in predicting spatio-temporal patterns across var-\\nious urban computing scenarios, we conducted experiments us-\\ning four distinct datasets: NYC-taxi, NYC-bike, NYC-crime, and\\nCHI-taxi. These datasets encompass a wide range of data sources\\nto capture the dynamic nature of urban environments, including\\nrecords of taxi travel, bike trajectories, crime incidents in New York\\nCity, and taxi travel data in Chicago. To facilitate our analysis, we\\npartitioned the cities into grid-like regions based on latitude and\\nlongitude information. Within specific time intervals, we aggre-\\ngated statistical measures for each region. For example, this in-\\nvolved calculating the number of taxi inflows and outflows within\\na 30-minute period in region A, or determining the count of theft\\nincidents within a day in region B. Furthermore, Points of Interest\\n(POIs) data can be obtained through APIs provided by map services,\\nutilizing the latitude and longitude of different regions. For more\\ncomprehensive data descriptions, please refer to the Appendix.\\n4.1.2 Evaluation Protocols. In order to investigate the capabili-\\nties of large language models in analyzing diverse spatio-temporal\\ndata across different regions, we selected a subset of taxi, bike, and\\ncrime data from various areas of New York City as our training set.\\n\u2022Zero-Shot Learning Scenarios . We assessed the model perfor-\\nmance by predicting future spatio-temporal data from regions in\\nNYC or even Chicago that were unseen in the training phase.\\n\u2022Supervised Learning Scenarios . We evaluated the model using\\nfuture data from the same regions as the training set.\\nFor regression tasks, we maintained a consistent training and test-\\ning methodology across all baseline models. When it came to classi-\\nfication tasks involving crime data, we utilized binary cross-entropy\\nas the loss function for training and testing the models. Our ex-\\nperiments were conducted using the robust vicuna-7b [ 50] as the\\nfoundational large language model for UrbanGPT. For a more com-\\nprehensive understanding of our methodology and experimental\\nsetup, please refer to the appendix for detailed information.4.1.3 Evaluation Metrics. For regression tasks, we employed\\nMAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)\\nas evaluation metrics. These metrics quantify the discrepancies\\nbetween the predicted outcomes and the actual labels, with lower\\nvalues indicating superior performance [ 12,49]. In the case of clas-\\nsification tasks, we utilized Recall and Macro-F1 as evaluation met-\\nrics to assess performance. Recall measures the model\u2019s ability to\\ncorrectly identify positive instances, while Macro-F1 is a compre-\\nhensive performance metric that combines precision and recall to\\nprovide an overall measure of classification accuracy [11, 30].\\n4.1.4 Baseline Model. We conducted a thorough comparison\\nwith 10 advanced models to establish baselines for our proposed\\nmethod. (i)In the category of RNNs-based spatio-temporal forecast-\\ning methods, we compared our proposed method with AGCRN [ 1],\\nDMVSTNET [ 39] and ST-LSTM [ 33]. These approaches leverage\\nRNNs for modeling and prediction. (ii)The GNNs-based spatio-\\ntemporal models primarily utilize graph neural networks to cap-\\nture spatial correlations and integrate temporal encoders to capture\\nspatio-temporal relationships. The models we compared against\\nin this category include GWN [ 37], MTGNN [ 36], STSGCN [ 26],\\nTGCN [ 47], and STGCN [ 42].(iii) In the attention-based spatio-\\ntemporal models category, the methods employ attention mecha-\\nnisms to model spatio-temporal correlations. The models we com-\\npared against in this category are ASTGCN [8] and STWA [5].\\n4.2 Zero-Shot Prediction Performance (RQ1)\\nIn this section, we thoroughly evaluate the predictive performance\\nof our proposed model in zero-shot scenarios. The results of our\\nevaluation are presented in Table 1 and visualized in Figure 4. Our\\nobjective is to assess the model\u2019s effectiveness in predicting spatio-\\ntemporal patterns in geographical areas that it has not encountered\\nduring training. This evaluation encompasses both cross-region\\nand cross-city settings, allowing us to gain insights into the model\u2019s\\ngeneralization capabilities across different locations.\\n4.2.1 Prediction on Unseen Regions within a City. Cross-\\nregion scenarios entail using data from certain regions within a\\ncity to forecast future conditions in other regions that have not\\nbeen encountered by the model. Through a thorough analysis of\\nthe model\u2019s performance in these cross-region predictions, we can\\ndraw attention to three significant observations:\\ni) Superior Zero-shot Predictive Performance . The results pre-\\nsented in Table 1 highlight the exceptional performance of our\\nproposed model in both regression and classification tasks on vari-\\nous datasets, surpassing the baseline models in zero-shot prediction.\\nThe success of our model can be attributed to two key factors.\\n\u2022Spatio-Temporal-Text-Alignment . The alignment of spatio-\\ntemporal contextual signals with the text comprehension abil-\\nities of language models plays a pivotal role in the success of\\nour proposed model. This fusion enables the model to effectively\\ncapitalize on both the encoded urban dynamics from the spa-\\ntiotemporal signals and the comprehensive understanding of\\ntextual context provided by the LLMs. By leveraging these two\\nessential aspects, our model achieves the remarkable ability to\\ngeneralize its prediction capabilities in zero-shot scenarios.\\n\\n## Page 6\\n\\nTable 1: Our model\u2019s performance in zero-shot prediction is evaluated on three diverse datasets: NYC-taxi, NYC-bike, and\\nNYC-crime, providing a comprehensive assessment of its predictive capabilities in unseen situations.\\nModelDataset NYC-taxi NYC-bike NYC-crime\\nType Inflow Outflow Inflow Outflow Burglary Robbery\\nMetrics MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE Macro-F1 Recall Macro-F1 Recall\\nAGCRN 10.86 26.51 13.15 36.45 3.41 7.98 3.42 8.08 0.48 0.00 0.49 0.01\\nASTGCN 9.75 24.12 12.42 33.28 5.58 11.58 5.78 12.29 0.49 0.01 0.55 0.09\\nGWN 10.73 26.50 9.67 26.74 3.32 8.17 3.07 7.52 0.48 0.00 0.52 0.04\\nMTGNN 10.16 25.84 12.59 35.38 3.18 7.62 3.20 7.65 0.64 0.27 0.65 0.30\\nSTWA 11.28 28.97 13.54 38.61 4.59 10.94 4.35 10.67 0.48 0.00 0.51 0.03\\nSTSGCN 18.97 41.38 20.07 45.79 6.85 14.98 6.54 14.77 0.48 0.00 0.48 0.00\\nSTGCN 12.54 30.80 14.32 39.58 4.11 9.21 4.45 9.62 0.48 0.00 0.64 0.30\\nTGCN 10.04 25.10 10.98 30.03 2.88 6.55 2.91 6.42 0.56 0.10 0.58 0.13\\nDMVSTNET 11.00 28.29 10.59 29.20 3.80 9.87 3.65 9.21 0.48 0.01 0.59 0.15\\nST-LSTM 16.97 34.43 18.93 44.10 7.78 15.41 6.92 17.12 0.48 0.00 0.49 0.03\\nUrbanGPT 6.16 16.92 6.83 21.78 2.02 5.16 2.01 5.03 0.67 0.34 0.69 0.42\\n\u2022Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning . This adaptive tuning\\nprocess empowers the LLM to effectively integrate crucial in-\\nformation from the instructions, enhancing its comprehension\\nof the complex relationships and dependencies between spatial\\nand temporal factors. By seamlessly merging the spatio-temporal\\ninstruction-tuning with the spatio-temporal dependency encoder,\\nour proposed model, UrbanGPT, successfully preserves universal\\nand transferable spatio-temporal knowledge. Consequently, the\\nmodel becomes capable of capturing the fundamental patterns\\nand dynamics that govern spatio-temporal phenomena, enabling\\nit to make precise predictions in downstream zero-shot scenarios.\\nii) Enhanced Urban Semantic Understanding . Urban seman-\\ntics offer valuable insights into the diverse dimensions of spatial\\nand temporal characteristics. Our approach involves training our\\nmodel on a wide range of datasets, enriching its understanding\\nof spatio-temporal dynamics across different timeframes and geo-\\ngraphical locations. In contrast, baseline models tend to prioritize\\nencoding temporal and spatial dependencies, neglecting the nu-\\nanced semantics that differentiate regions, timeframes, and data\\ncategories. By incorporating comprehensive semantic awareness\\ninto our UrbanGPT, we significantly enhance its ability to make\\naccurate zero-shot predictions in previously unseen regions.\\niii) Improved Performance in Sparse Data Scenarios . Predict-\\ning spatio-temporal patterns in sparse data environments is chal-\\nlenging as models tend to overfit when data points are scarce. This\\nchallenge is particularly notable when predicting crimes, where data\\nis often sparse but crucial for accurate predictions. Baseline mod-\\nels struggle in cross-regional prediction tasks under these sparse\\nconditions, resulting in low recall scores that indicate potential over-\\nfitting. To overcome this limitation, our model integrates spatio-\\ntemporal learning with large language models (LLMs) using an\\neffective spatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm. By incorpo-\\nrating rich semantic insights, our approach enhances the model\u2019s\\nspatio-temporal representations, enabling it to effectively handle\\nsparse data and achieve improved prediction accuracy.\\n4.2.2 Cross-City Prediction Task. To assess the performance of\\nour model in cross-city prediction tasks, we conducted tests on the\\nCHI-taxi dataset, which was not seen during the training phase. The\\nresults, depicted in Figure 4, yielded the following observations:\u2022Consistency in Multi-step Prediction : Our model consistently\\noutperforms the comparison method at each time step. Notably,\\nit maintains a significant advantage in both short-term and long-\\nterm spatio-temporal prediction, demonstrating the robustness\\nof our proposed model in cross-city prediction scenarios.\\n\u2022Effective Knowledge Transfer Across Cities : The prediction\\nresults obtained from the CHI-taxi dataset validate the supe-\\nrior forecasting capabilities of our model in cross-city scenarios.\\nThis enhancement can be attributed to the integration of spatio-\\ntemporal encoders with the spatio-temporal instruction-tuning\\nparadigm. By incorporating these components, our model ef-\\nfectively captures universal and transferable spatio-temporal\\npatterns, allowing it to make accurate predictions. Additionally,\\nby considering different geographical information and temporal\\nfactors alongside the learned transferred knowledge, our model\\nsuccessfully associates spatio-temporal patterns exhibited by\\nsimilar functional areas and historical periods. This comprehen-\\nsive understanding provides valuable insights for making precise\\nzero-shot predictions in cross-city scenarios.\\n4.3 Classical Supervised Prediction Task (RQ2)\\nThis section examines the predictive capabilities of our UrbanGPT\\nin end-to-end supervised prediction scenarios, as presented in Ta-\\nble 2. We will discuss the results from two perspectives below.\\nEnhanced Long-Term Forecasting Abilities : We examined the\\nmodel\u2019s effectiveness in long-term spatio-temporal forecasting by\\nutilizing test datasets that spanned broader time intervals. For in-\\nstance, we trained the model using data from 2017 and evaluated its\\nperformance on data from 2021. The results of these experiments\\ndemonstrate that our UrbanGPT possesses a significant advantage\\nover the baselines, highlighting its superior ability to generalize\\nacross different temporal landscapes. This capability reduces the\\nneed for frequent retraining or incremental updates, making the\\nmodel more aligned with real-world applications. Additionally, the\\nexperiments have confirmed that incorporating additional textual\\nknowledge does not hinder model performance or introduce noise,\\nthus further validating the feasibility of utilizing large language\\nmodels to enhance spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.\\nSpatial Semantic Understanding : Accurately capturing spatial\\ncorrelations is crucial in the realm of spatio-temporal prediction.\\n\\n## Page 7\\n\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon23456 MAE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOurs\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon3456789101112131415 RMSE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOurs\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon12345 MAE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOurs\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon456789101112131415 RMSE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOursFigure 4: Time step-based prediction comparison experiment conducted on the CHI-taxi dataset.\\nTable 2: Evaluation of performance in the end-to-end super-\\nvised setting on the NYC-taxi and NYC-bike datasets.\\nModelNYC-taxi NYC-bike\\nInflow Outflow Inflow Outflow\\nMAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE\\nAGCRN 2.83 8.35 2.62 9.21 3.30 7.65 3.38 7.73\\nASTGCN 5.41 18.04 5.00 19.29 3.87 7.93 3.66 7.69\\nGWN 3.91 11.93 2.89 10.85 4.30 9.04 3.88 8.29\\nMTGNN 3.09 10.13 2.61 10.96 3.31 7.47 3.26 7.61\\nSTWA 3.90 12.64 3.15 11.32 4.23 9.07 4.18 9.18\\nSTSGCN 4.57 13.93 4.41 15.87 5.10 12.23 4.72 10.78\\nSTGCN 3.45 9.82 3.17 10.53 3.88 9.23 3.90 9.08\\nTGCN 3.99 11.47 3.31 11.58 4.12 7.92 4.11 7.84\\nDMVSTNET 3.83 11.55 2.76 9.88 3.71 7.95 3.69 7.92\\nST-LSTM 7.78 15.41 6.92 17.12 5.00 11.52 4.96 11.41\\nUrbanGPT 2.50 6.78 1.71 6.68 3.11 7.10 3.01 6.94\\nTraditional methods often employ graph networks or attention\\nmechanisms to analyze these correlations.

In contrast, our model com-\\npensates for the absence of explicit spatial encoders by integrating\\nextensive geographic and points of interest (POIs) data within the\\ntextual input. This approach enables the model to comprehend the\\nshared characteristics of areas with similar functions at a higher\\nsemantic level. Consequently, it deduces patterns of correlation\\nbetween various functional zones and effectively represents the\\ninterconnections among different regions.\\n4.4 Ablation study (RQ3)\\nThis section investigates the impact of different key components\\non the performance of our model, as illustrated in Figure 5. Our\\nrigorous testing primarily revolves around the zero-shot scenario\\nusing the NYC-taxi dataset. Through our analysis, we have distilled\\nthe benefits offered by the different modules into four key points.\\n\u2022(1) Impact of Spatial and Temporal Context :-STC . By re-\\nmoving time and spatial information from the instruction text,\\nwe observed a noticeable decline in the model\u2019s performance.\\nThis can be attributed to the lack of temporal information, forcing\\nthe model to rely solely on spatio-temporal encoders for encoding\\ntime-related features and performing prediction tasks. Furthermore,\\nthe absence of spatial information hindered the model\u2019s ability to\\ncapture spatial correlations, making it challenging to analyze the\\ndistinct spatio-temporal patterns of different areas.\\n\u2022(2) Impact of Instruction-Tuning with Diverse Datasets :-\\nMulti .

As a result, the model\u2019s per-\\nformance was suboptimal. By integrating diverse spatio-temporal\\ndata from multiple sources, our model can effectively capture the\\nunique characteristics of different geographical locations and their\\nevolving spatio-temporal patterns.\\n\u2022(3) Impact of Spatio-Temporal Encoder :-STE . In this vari-\\nant, we disable the spatio-temporal encoder to investigate its\\neffect on aligning the large language model with encoded urban\\ndependency dynamics into latent embedding space.\\nThe results clearly indicate that the absence of the spatio-temporal\\nencoder significantly hampers the performance of the large lan-\\nguage model in spatio-temporal prediction scenarios. This under-\\nscores the crucial role played by the proposed spatio-temporal\\nencoder in enhancing the model\u2019s predictive capabilities.\\n\u2022(4) Regression Layer Incorporation in Instruction-Tuning:\\nT2P. We explicitly instructed UrbanGPT to generate its predic-\\ntions in a textual format. However, the suboptimal performance\\nindicates the challenges in utilizing LLMs for precise numerical\\nregression tasks, as opposed to employing regression layers.\\nThe primary challenge stems from the model\u2019s dependence on\\nmulti-class loss for optimization during training, leading to a mis-\\nmatch between the model\u2019s probabilistic output and the continuous\\nvalue distribution necessary for spatio-temporal forecasting. To\\nbridge this gap, we incorporated a regression predictor into our\\nmodel, significantly improving its capacity to generate more precise\\nnumerical predictions for regression tasks.\\n4.5 Model Robustness Study (RQ4)\\nIn this section, we focus on evaluating the robustness of our Ur-\\nbanGPT across different spatio-temporal pattern scenarios. We cate-\\ngorize regions based on the magnitude of numerical variations, such\\nas taxi flow, during a specific time period. Lower variance indicates\\nstable temporal patterns, while higher variance suggests diverse\\nspatio-temporal patterns in active commercial zones or densely\\npopulated areas.

However, the baseline model struggles in\\nregions with high variance, particularly within the (0.75, 1.0] range,\\nresulting in inaccurate predictions.

For a more comprehensive\\nunderstanding, please refer to the Appendix.\\n5 RELATED WORK\\nDeep Spatio-temporal Prediction Models . Deep spatio-temporal\\nprediction methods have gained prominence in deep learning due\\nto their impressive performance. These models typically consist of\\ntwo components: temporal dependency modeling and spatial corre-\\nlation encoding. Early models like D-LSTM [ 43] and ST-resnet [ 45]\\nused RNNs and convolutional networks to model temporal and\\nspatial dependencies. Graph neural networks (GNNs) proved to\\nbe a natural fit for spatial correlation modeling, as seen in models\\nlike STGCN [ 42] and DCRNN [ 14], which utilized graph structures\\nbased on node distances. Techniques such as learnable region-wise\\ngraph structures [ 36,37] and dynamic spatio-temporal graph net-\\nworks [9, 48] have further enhanced spatial correlation modeling.\\nFurthermore, researchers have explored approaches such as\\nmulti-scale temporal learning [ 34] and multi-granularity tempo-\\nral learning [ 8] to encode temporal dependencies. These strategies\\nenable the capture of features like long-term and short-term correla-\\ntions as well as periodicity. These advancements have significantlycontributed to the progress of spatio-temporal prediction. However,\\nit is worth noting that the majority of these studies are tailored\\nfor supervised contexts, with limited research and development\\nfocused on zero-shot spatio-temporal forecasting. This represents\\nan important area that requires further exploration.\\nSpatio-Temporal Pre-training . Spatio-temporal pre-training tech-\\nniques have recently received significant research attention. These\\ntechniques primarily focus on generative [ 16,24] and contrastive [ 46]\\npre-training models to enhance the predictive performance of down-\\nstream tasks. There has also been extensive exploration of pretrain-\\nfinetune frameworks for few-shot learning scenarios [ 13,19], aim-\\ning to improve knowledge transferability by aligning source and\\ntarget data. However, these approaches require training or fine-\\ntuning on target data and lack zero-shot prediction capabilities. In\\nthis work, we address the challenge of data scarcity in downstream\\nurban scenarios by proposing UrbanGPT. Our model demonstrates\\nthe ability to generalize well across various scenarios, mitigating\\nthe need for extensive training or fine-tuning on target data.\\nLarge Language Models. The emergence of large language mod-\\nels [3,21] has recently attracted significant attention due to their\\nunprecedented machine performance in tasks like text understand-\\ning and reasoning. These models have become a hot topic, demon-\\nstrating the potential to advance from intelligent algorithms to\\nartificial intelligence. Open-source large language models such as\\nLlama [ 28,29], Vicuna [ 50], and ChatGLM [ 44] have been released,\\nleading to researchers exploring their application in various fields\\nto enhance transfer learning capabilities with domain knowledge\\nfrom these models. In the computer vision domain, researchers\\nhave combined multimodal large language models with prompt\\nlearning methods to achieve zero-shot predictions in downstream\\ntasks [ 25,51,52]. Furthermore, the capabilities of LLMs in graph\\nreasoning [ 2,4,27], recommendation [ 10,23,35] and traffic anal-\\nysis [ 6] have been extensively studied. However, the utilization\\nof large language models for zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction\\ntasks in the field of urban intelligence remains largely unexplored.\\n6 CONCLUSION\\nWe present the UrbanGPT, a spatio-temporal large language model,\\nto generalize well in diverse urban scenarios. To seamlessly align\\nthe spatio-temporal contextual signals with LLMs, we introduce a\\nspatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm. This empowers the\\nUrbanGPT with the remarkable ability to learn universal and trans-\\nferable spatio-temporal patterns across various types of urban data.\\nThrough extensive experiments and meticulous ablation studies,\\nwe demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of the UrbanGPT\u2019s\\narchitecture and its key components. However, it is important to\\nacknowledge that while the results are promising, there are still\\nlimitations to be addressed in future studies. As a first step, we are\\nactively engaged in collecting a more diverse range of urban data\\nto enhance and refine the capabilities of our UrbanGPT across a\\nbroader spectrum of urban computing domains. Additionally, un-\\nderstanding the decision-making process of our UrbanGPT is of im-\\nportance. While the model demonstrates exceptional performance,\\nproviding interpretability and explainability is equally essential.\\nFuture research efforts will focus on empowering our model with\\nthe ability to interpret and explain its predictions.\\n\\n## Page 9\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n[1]Lei Bai, Lina Yao, Can Li, Xianzhi Wang, and Can Wang. 2020.

This includes detailed dataset informa-\\ntion, hyperparameter configuration, experimental setting for the\\ninstruction-tuning phase and test phase, as well as the baselines.\\nFurthermore, we present a case study of our UrbanGPT, showcasing\\nits effectiveness for zero-shot spatio-temporal predictions.\\nA.1 Experimental Details Description\\nA.1.1 Dataset Details. We collected data on taxi flows, bicycle\\nflows, and crime incidents in New York City for training and evalu-\\nation. The NYC-taxi dataset contains 263 regions, with each region\\nmeasuring approximately 3km x 3km. The time sampling inter-\\nval for this dataset is 30 minutes. The NYC-bike and NYC-crime\\ndatasets consist of 2162 regions, each represented by a 1km x 1km\\ngrid. The time sampling interval for NYC-bike is also 30 minutes,\\nwhile for NYC-crime, it is 1 day. All datasets cover the time period\\nfrom Jan 1, 2016, to Dec 31, 2021, in NYC. The CHI-taxi dataset\\nincludes 77 regions, with each region measuring approximately\\n4km x 4km. This dataset includes all taxi data from January 1, 2021,\\nto December 31, 2021, with a time sampling interval of 30 minutes.\\nA.1.2 Hyperparameters Settings. The parameters for the di-\\nlation convolution kernel in the time encoder are set as follows:\\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b,\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61, and\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61are all set to 32, with a dilation factor of 1. For\\nour prediction task, we aim to predict the next 12 steps of data\\nbased on the previous 12 steps. Both the history length ( \ud835\udc3b) and\\nprediction length ( \ud835\udc43) are set to 12. The projection layer parameters\\nare configured with \ud835\udc51set to 64 and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3fset to 4096. Lastly, the hidden\\nlayer parameter \ud835\udc51\u2032for the regression layer is set to 128.\\nA.1.3 Further Experimental Setup Descriptions. During the\\ninstruction-tuning phase, we randomly selected 80 regions from\\nthe three datasets in New York City as training data. It\u2019s important\\nto note that the region indices were kept consistent for the NYC-\\nbike and NYC-crime datasets. The training sets had specific time\\nintervals: for NYC-taxi datasets, it ranged from January 1, 2017,\\nto March 31, 2017; for NYC-bike datasets, it covered April 1, 2017,\\nto June 30, 2017; and for NYC-crime datasets, it spanned from\\nJanuary 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018. For the pretraining of the\\nspatio-temporal dependency encoder and the baseline models, we\\nutilized the same data for training to optimize the parameters. The\\nmaximum epoch count was set at 100. In the testing phase, we\\nconducted the following evaluations:\\n\u2022(i)Zero-Shot Prediction . We also selected an additional 80\\nregions from the New York City datasets as unseen test data. For\\nthe NYC-bike and NYC-taxi datasets, we used the first two weeks\\nof data in 2020 for testing. As for the NYC-crime dataset, we used\\nthe entire year of 2020 for testing. In the case of the Chicago city\\ndataset, we evaluated the model using all the data from Dec 2021.\\n\u2022(ii)Classical Supervised Prediction : For evaluation purposes,\\nwe chose the data with the longest time interval, which involved\\ntesting the model using all the data from the NYC-bike and NYC-\\ntaxi datasets specifically for the month of December 2021.\\nA.1.4 Baseline Details. To facilitate our discussion, we have\\ncategorized all the baselines into three distinct categories: RNN-\\nbased models, attention-based models, and graph neural network(GNN)-based spatio-temporal prediction models. Below, we provide\\ndetailed descriptions of each baseline category:\\nRNN-based Spatio-Temporal Methods:\\n\u2022ST-LSTM [33]: It incorporates the Long Short-Term Memory to\\ncapture temporal dependencies in the spatio-temporal data.\\n\u2022AGCRN [1]: RNNs are employed to capture temporal correlations,\\nallowing for the representation of the evolving patterns over time.\\n\u2022DMVSTNET [39]: In this method, RNNs are utilized to effectively\\nmodel temporal dependencies, capturing the patterns that evolve\\nover time. Furthermore, convolutional networks and fully con-\\nnected layers are employed to capture local spatial correlations\\nand establish meaningful spatial relationships.\\nAttention-based Spatio-Temporal Approaches:\\n\u2022ASTGCN [8]: In this method, attention mechanisms are employed\\nto capture multi-granularity temporal correlation features.\\n\u2022STWA [5]: The model incorporates personalized temporal and\\nspatial parameters into the attention module, allowing for the\\nmodeling of dynamic spatio-temporal correlations.\\nSpatio-Temporal GNNs:\\n\u2022GWN [37]: It incorporates a learnable graph structure and 1-D\\nconvolutions to effectively learn spatio-temporal dependencies.\\n\u2022MTGNN [36]: It utilizes a learnable graph structure to model\\nmultivariate temporal correlations. MTGNN employs 1-D dilation\\nconvolutions to generate temporal representations.\\n\u2022TGCN [47]: This model combines graph neural networks (GNNs)\\nfor spatial correlation modeling and recurrent neural networks\\n(RNNs) for temporal correlation modeling.\\n\u2022STGCN [42]: It uses gated temporal convolutions and GNNs to\\nmodel temporal and spatial dependencies, respectively.\\n\u2022STSGCN [26]: It introduces a spatio-temporal graph construction\\nto learn spatial correlations across adjacent time steps.\\nA.2 Case study\\nIn this section, we assess the effectiveness of different large lan-\\nguage models (LLMs) in zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction sce-\\nnarios, as illustrated in Table 3 and Table 4. The instructions pro-\\nvided to the models are clearly indicated in blue font. The results\\ndemonstrate that various LLMs are capable of generating predic-\\ntions based on these instructions, thereby highlighting the effective-\\nness of the prompt design. For instance, ChatGPT relies on historical\\naverages rather than explicitly incorporating temporal or spatial\\ndata in its predictions. Llama-2-70b analyzes specific time periods\\nand regions, but it encounters challenges in encoding numerical\\ntime-series dependencies, resulting in suboptimal predictive perfor-\\nmance. On the other hand, Claude-2.1 effectively summarizes and\\nanalyzes historical data, leveraging peak-hour patterns and points\\nof interest to achieve more accurate traffic trend predictions.\\nOur proposed UrbanGPT seamlessly integrates spatio-temporal\\ncontextual signals with the reasoning capabilities of large language\\nmodels (LLMs) through a spatio-temporal instruction-tuning para-\\ndigm. This integration leads to remarkable improvements in predict-\\ning numerical values and spatio-temporal trends. These findings\\nunderscore the potential and effectiveness of our framework in\\ncapturing universal spatio-temporal patterns, making zero-shot\\nspatio-temporal prediction practical and achievable.\\n\\n## Page 11\\n\\nTable 3: We examine the zero-shot predictions of different LLMs for bicycle flow in NYC with the provided instructions.\\nInstructions: Given the historical data for bike flow over 12 time steps in a specific region of New York City, the recorded bike inflows\\nare [12 8 9 15 10 12 14 9 6 12 25 20], and the recorded bike outflows are [5 12 12 15 10 11 6 9 4 6 10 15].

We now aim to\\npredict the bike inflow and outflow for the next 12 time steps during the time period of \u2019January 14, 2020, 18:00, Tuesday to January 14,\\n2020, 23:30, Tuesday, with data points recorded at 30-minute intervals\u2019. To improve prediction accuracy, a spatio-temporal model is\\nutilized to encode the historical bike data as tokens <ST_Start><ST_HIS><ST_HIS><ST_End>, where the first and the second tokens\\ncorrespond to the representations of bike inflow and outflow. Please conduct an analysis of the traffic patterns in this region, taking into\\naccount the provided time and regional information, and then generate the predictions (the predictive tokens for regression).\\nGround true: Based on the given information, the predictions of bike inflow and outflow in this region are [26 38 28 24 20 13 16 9 5 3\\n5 2] and[12 19 10 10 11 9 6 5 4 4 2 2] .\\nLlama-2-70b Responds: Based on the provided historical data, I have ...

Predicted Bike Outflow: [9.58 9.58... 9.58] ...\\nClaude-2.1 Responds: Based on the provided historical data, this region in Staten Island seems to experience fluctuating yet relatively\\nlow bike traffic flow during the daytime on Tuesdays. The bike inflows range from 6 to 15 per 30-minute interval, while outflows range\\nfrom 4 to 15.Given the region covers education, cultural, commercial, and transportation facilities within a 1km radius, the bike traffic\\nlikely corresponds to people traveling to and from these points of interest. The fluctuations could reflect class/work schedules and\\ntransportation needs throughout the day.For the evening prediction period of 6PM to 11:30PM, we may expect some further fluctuations\\nbut generally declining bike traffic as the day turns to night. People would be finishing up activities and heading home. I would predict\\nthe following bike inflows and outflows for the next 12 time steps: [10 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 1 1] and[8 6 5 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 1 1] ...\\nUrbanGPT Responds: Based on the given information, the predictions (predicted tokens) of bike inflow and outflow in this region are\\n<ST_PRE> [20 21 22 21 17 12 9 7 6 5 5 5] and <ST_PRE> [11 10 8 7 6 6 5 4 4 3 3 2] .\\nTable 4: Zero-shot predictions of different LLMs for taxi flow in NYC with the provided instructions (without spatial information).\\nInstructions: Given the historical data for taxi flow over 12 time steps in a specific region of New York City, the recorded taxi inflows\\nare [111 86 90 78 49 75 46 32 20 14 9 9], and the recorded taxi outflows are [100 91 58 39 47 47 19 22 21 9 16 10].

Predicted taxi outflows: [40.83 40.83... 40.83] ...\\nClaude-2.1 Responds: The data covers evening hours on a Sunday and early morning hours on a Monday. We can expect lower taxi\\ndemand during later Sunday evening, with some pickup around end-of-weekend times and early Monday commute times. The region\\nis unspecified, so we cannot infer any location-specific usage patterns. Inflow ranges from 49-111 taxis over the 30 minute intervals.\\nOutflow ranges from 19-100 taxis. This indicates the region likely serves both residential and commercial purposes.\\nPrediction: Inflows: [25 15 10 8 7 9 15 25 35 40 45 50] .

This has significant implications in the field\\nof urban computing, where the ability to predict transportation\\npatterns can optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance\\noverall urban mobility [ 18,31]. Moreover, anticipating population\\nmovement can aid in effective urban planning and resource alloca-\\ntion [ 7,20]. Additionally, the ability to forecast crimes can greatly\\ncontribute to enhancing public safety [ 32]. Spatio-temporal predic-\\ntion plays a vital role in shaping smarter and more efficient cities,\\nultimately leading to an improved quality of urban life.\\nIt is important to highlight the various types of neural network\\narchitectures commonly adopted in this domain of spatio-temporal\\nprediction. These architectures are designed to capture and model\\nthe complex relationships between spatial and temporal dimensions\\nin the data. One widely employed architecture is the Convolutional\\nNeural Network (CNN) [ 15,39,45], which is effective in extract-\\ning spatial features by applying convolutional filters across the\\ninput data. Another line of spatio-temporal neural networks is the\\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) family [ 1,34,43]. Those spatio-\\ntemporal RNNs are well-suited for capturing temporal dependencies\\nby maintaining a memory state that can retain information over\\ntime. Recently, there has been a surge in the use of Graph Neural\\nNetworks (GNNs) for spatio-temporal prediction [ 36,40,47]. GNNs\\nexcel in modeling complex spatial relationships in data represented\\nas graphs, where each node corresponds to a spatial location and\\nedges capture the connections between them.\\nWhile current spatio-temporal neural network techniques have\\nproven to be highly effective, it is crucial to acknowledge their\\nstrong dependence on having an abundance of labeled data in order\\nto generate accurate predictions. However, the pervasive problem\\nof data scarcity in practical urban sensing scenarios poses a sig-\\nnificant challenge. For example, deploying sensors throughout the\\nentire urban space to monitor citywide traffic volume or air qual-\\nity is impractical due to the high cost involved [ 17,41]. Moreover,\\nthe challenge of limited labeled data availability extends to spatio-\\ntemporal forecasting across different cities, in which acquiring\\nlabeled data for each target city becomes a daunting task [ 13,38].\\nThese issues emphasize the pressing need for novel solutions that\\naddress data scarcity and enhance the generalization capabilities of\\nspatio-temporal models in various smart city applications.\\nInspired by the remarkable progress of large language models\\n(LLMs), our primary goal is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that\\npossesses outstanding generalization capabilities across a wide\\narray of urban tasks. Leveraging the reasoning abilities inherent in\\nLLMs, we aim to expand their success into the domain of spatio-\\ntemporal analysis. Our objective is to develop a model that can\\neffectively comprehend and forecast intricate spatial and temporal\\npatterns, enabling it to excel in various urban scenarios.\\nWhile it is of utmost importance to develop a versatile spatio-\\ntemporal model capable of effectively handling diverse downstreamarXiv:2403.00813v3  [cs.CL]  19 May 2024\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 2\\n\\nInstruction s:Given thehistorical data fortaxiflow over 12time steps inaspecific region ofNew York City, the\\nrecorded taxiinflows are[9194100 939376676650695542],and therecorded taxioutflows are[9691108\\n10283787674106938657]\u2026Please predict thetaxiinflow and outflow fornext 12time steps\u2026\\nLabel s:Taxi Inflow :[5536333033273714167512]Taxi Outflow :[547069593231292120111312].\\nOurs :Based onthegiven information, thepredictions oftaxiinflow and outflow inthisregion are\u2026\\nPrediction :Inflow :[514845424038332824211816]Outflow :[544945413835302521181614].\\nHuman\\nInstructions\\nLLAMA -70BGround true\\nPrediction :Inflow :[282827262524232323232424]Outflow :[343128252219171616151515] Baseline\\nLLM :There isanoticeable spike intaxiinflows and outflows around 10:00-11:00,which may indicate asurge in\\ndemand fortaxiservices\u2026Ihave created apredictive model toforecast thetaxiflow forthenext 12time steps :\\nPrediction :Inflow :[53586460677378849196102 108]Outflow :[5661687379848995102 107 113 119]\\nUrbanGPT\\n2 4 6 8 10 12\\nTime Steps020406080100 Inflow Predicted valueBaseline\\nLLM\\nOurs\\nGround_true\\n2 4 6 8 10 12\\nTime Steps020406080100120 Outflow Predicted valueBaseline\\nLLM\\nOurs\\nGround_trueFigure 1: The superior predictive performance of the pro-\\nposed UrbanGPT compared to the large language model\\n(LLaMA-70B) and the spatiotemporal graph neural network\\n(STGCN) in a zero-shot traffic flow prediction scenario.\\ntasks, aligning the spatio-temporal context with the knowledge\\nspace of large language models (LLMs) and enabling them to com-\\nprehend the complex dependencies across time and space present\\nsignificant challenges. These hurdles call for meticulous model\\ndesign to bridge the gap between the unique characteristics of\\nspatio-temporal data and the knowledge encoded within LLMs.\\nContributions . In light of these challenges, we propose UrbanGPT,\\na large language model specifically tailored for spatio-temporal\\nprediction. At the core of UrbanGPT lies a novel spatio-temporal\\ninstruction-tuning paradigm that seeks to align the intricate de-\\npendencies of time and space, with the knowledge space of LLMs.\\nWithin our UrbanGPT framework, we start by incorporating a\\nspatio-temporal dependency encoder, which utilizes a multi-level\\ntemporal convolutional network. This encoder enables the model\\nto capture the intricate temporal dynamics present in the spatio-\\ntemporal data across various time resolutions. Then, our model\\ninvolves aligning textual and spatio-temporal information to em-\\npower language models in effectively injecting spatio-temporal\\ncontextual signals. This is achieved through the utilization of a\\nlightweight alignment module that projects the representations\\nof spatio-temporal dependencies. The result is the generation of\\nmore expressive semantic representations by integrating valuable\\ninformation from both textual and spatio-temporal domains.\\nThrough the incorporation of spatio-temporal information dur-\\ning the instruction-tuning process, the language model gains profi-\\nciency in understanding and processing the intricate relationships\\nand patterns found in spatio-temporal data. By leveraging the in-\\nsights obtained from the spatio-temporal domain, the language\\nmodel becomes better equipped to capture the nuances and com-\\nplexities of spatio-temporal phenomena. This, in turn, enables the\\nmodel to make more reliable and insightful predictions across vari-\\nous urban scenarios, even when faced with limited data availability.\\nTo showcase the superior predictive performance of our pro-\\nposed model, we compare it with the large language model (LLaMA-\\n70B) and the spatio-temporal graph neural network (STGCN) in azero-shot traffic flow prediction scenario guided by textual instruc-\\ntions, as depicted in Figure 1. The large language model, LLaMA,\\neffectively infers traffic patterns from the input text. However, its\\nlimitations in handling numeric time-series data with complex spa-\\ntial and temporal dependencies can sometimes lead to opposite\\ntraffic trend predictions. On the other hand, the pre-trained base-\\nline model demonstrates a strong understanding of spatio-temporal\\ndependencies. However, it may suffer from overfitting to the source\\ndataset and underperform in zero-shot scenarios, indicating its lim-\\nited generalization capabilities beyond existing spatio-temporal\\nprediction models. In contrast, our proposed model achieves a har-\\nmonious integration of domain-specific spatio-temporal knowledge\\nand language modeling capabilities. This enables us to make more\\naccurate and reliable predictions under data scarcity.\\nIn summary, our main contributions can be outlined as follows:\\n\u2022To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop\\na spatio-temporal large language model capable of predicting\\ndiverse urban phenomena across different datasets, especially\\nunder conditions of limited data availability.\\n\u2022We propose UrbanGPT, a spatio-temporal prediction framework\\nthat empowers large language models (LLMs) to comprehend\\nthe intricate inter-dependencies across time and space. This is\\nachieved through the seamless integration of a spatio-temporal\\ndependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm, ef-\\nfectively aligning the spatio-temporal context with LLMs.\\n\u2022Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets\\nprovide compelling evidence of our proposed UrbanGPT\u2019s excep-\\ntional ability to generalize in zero-shot spatio-temporal learning\\nscenarios. These findings highlight the model\u2019s robust general-\\nization capacity, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately\\npredicting and understanding spatio-temporal patterns, even in\\nscenarios where no prior training data is available.\\n2 PRELIMINARIES\\nSpatio-Temporal Data . Spatio-temporal data is commonly col-\\nlected and can be represented as a three-dimensional tensor X\u2208\\nR\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc47\u00d7\ud835\udc39. Each element X\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udc53in the tensor corresponds to the value\\nof the\ud835\udc53-th feature at the \ud835\udc61-th time interval in the \ud835\udc5f-th region. To\\nprovide an example, let\u2019s consider predicting taxi traffic patterns in\\nan urban area. In this scenario, the data can represent the inflow\\nand outflow of taxis in a specific region ( e.g., the\ud835\udc5f-th spatial area)\\nduring a given time period from \ud835\udc61to\ud835\udc61\u22121(e.g., a 30-minute interval).\\nSpatio-Temporal Forecasting. In spatio-temporal prediction tasks,\\na common scenario involves forecasting future trends using histor-\\nical data. Specifically, the goal is to predict the data for the next \ud835\udc43\\ntime steps based on information from the preceding \ud835\udc3bsteps.\\nX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+\ud835\udc43=\ud835\udc53(X\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e\u2212\ud835\udc3b+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e) (1)\\nThe function \ud835\udc53(\u00b7)represents a spatio-temporal prediction model\\nthat has been trained effectively using historical data. Spatio-temporal\\nprediction tasks can be divided into two main categories: regression\\nprediction, which involves predicting continuous values like traffic\\nflow or taxi demand [ 22], and classification prediction, where the\\ngoal is to classify events such as crime occurrence prediction [ 11].\\nTo optimize the model \ud835\udc53(\u00b7), different loss functions are utilized\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 3\\n\\nbased on the specific characteristics of the spatio-temporal scenar-\\nios.\\nSpatio-Temporal Zero-Shot Learning . Despite the effectiveness\\nof current spatio-temporal learning approaches, they often en-\\ncounter difficulties in effectively generalizing across a wide range of\\ndownstream spatio-temporal learning scenarios. In this study, our\\nfocus is on addressing the challenge of spatio-temporal zero-shot\\nscenarios, where we aim to learn from previously unseen data in\\ndownstream spatio-temporal prediction datasets or tasks. This can\\nbe formally defined as follows:\\n\u02dcX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+\ud835\udc43=\u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u02dcX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e\u2212\ud835\udc3b+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e) (2)\\nIn this particular scenario, the prediction function \u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u00b7)is responsi-\\nble for forecasting the spatio-temporal data \u02dcXfrom downstream\\ntasks that have not been previously encountered. It should be noted\\nthat the model \u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u00b7)is not trained specifically on the target data.\\n3 METHODOLOGY\\n3.1 Spatio-Temporal Dependency Encoder\\nAlthough large language models demonstrate exceptional profi-\\nciency in language processing, they face challenges in comprehend-\\ning the time-evolving patterns inherent in spatio-temporal data. To\\novercome this limitation, we propose enhancing the capability of\\nlarge language models to capture temporal dependencies within\\nspatio-temporal contexts. This is accomplished by integrating a\\nspatio-temporal encoder that incorporates a multi-level tempo-\\nral convolutional network. By doing so, we enable the model to\\neffectively capture the intricate temporal dependencies across vari-\\nous time resolutions, thereby improving its understanding of the\\ncomplex temporal dynamics present in the spatio-temporal data.\\nSpecifically, our spatio-temporal encoder is composed of two key\\ncomponents: a gated dilated convolution layer and a multi-level\\ncorrelation injection layer. Let\u2019s formalize this architecture as:\\n\u03a8(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f=(\u00afW(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc58\u2217E(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+\u00afb(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc58)\u00b7\ud835\udeff(\u00afW(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc54\u2217E(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+\u00afb(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc54)+E\u2032(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f (3)\\nWe begin with the initial spatio-temporal embedding, denoted as\\nE\ud835\udc5f\u2208R\ud835\udc47\u00d7\ud835\udc51. This embedding is obtained by enhancing the original\\ndata Xthrough a linear layer. To address the issue of gradient\\nvanishing, we utilize a slice of E\ud835\udc5f, denoted as E\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5f\u2208R\ud835\udc47\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51, which\\nis determined by the size of the dilated convolutional kernel. This\\nslice is employed for performing residual operations. To perform\\nthe residual operations, we use 1-D dilated convolution kernels\\n\u00afW\ud835\udc58and \u00afW\ud835\udc54\u2208R\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc54\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61, along with the corresponding bias\\nterms \u00afb\ud835\udc58and \u00afb\ud835\udc54\u2208R\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61. The sigmoid activation function \ud835\udeffis\\napplied to control the degree of information preservation during the\\nrepeated convolution operation. After the gated temporal dilated\\nconvolutional layer encoding, we are able to effectively capture the\\ntemporal dependencies across multiple time steps, resulting in the\\ngeneration of temporal representations.\\nThese representations contain different levels of temporal de-\\npendencies, reflecting various granularity-aware time-evolving pat-\\nterns. To preserve these informative patterns, we introduce a multi-\\nlevel correlation injection layer. This layer is designed to incorpo-\\nrate correlations between different levels and is formalized as:\\nS(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f=(W(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc60\u2217\u03a8(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+b(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc60)+S(\ud835\udc59\u22121)\\n\ud835\udc5f (4)We have the convolution kernel W\ud835\udc60\u2208R\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc46\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\u00d7\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61and the bias\\nvector b\ud835\udc60\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61. These are employed after \ud835\udc3flayers of encoding.\\nA simple non-linear layer is employed to merge the results from\\nequations 3 and 4, and the final spatio-temporal dependency repre-\\nsentations of are denoted as \u02dc\u03a8\u2208R\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc39\u00d7\ud835\udc51. To address the diverse\\nset of urban scenarios that may arise downstream, our proposed\\nspatio-temporal encoder is designed to be independent of graph\\nstructures when modeling spatial correlations. This is particularly\\ncrucial because in zero-shot prediction contexts, the spatial rela-\\ntionships between entities may be unknown or difficult to ascertain.\\nBy not relying on explicit graph structures, our encoder can effec-\\ntively handle a broad spectrum of urban scenarios, where spatial\\ncorrelations and dependencies can vary or be challenging to define\\nin advance. This flexibility enables our model to adapt and perform\\nwell, ensuring its applicability in a wide range of urban contexts.\\n3.2 Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning\\n3.2.1 Spatio-Temporal-Text Alignment. In order to enable lan-\\nguage models to effectively comprehend spatio-temporal patterns,\\nit is crucial to align textual and spatio-temporal information. This\\nalignment allows for the fusion of different modalities, resulting\\nin a more informative representation. By integrating contextual\\nfeatures from both textual and spatio-temporal domains, we can\\ncapture complementary information and extract higher-level se-\\nmantic representations that are more expressive and meaningful.\\nTo achieve this objective, we utilize a lightweight alignment mod-\\nule to project the spatio-temporal dependencies representations\\n\u02dc\u03a8. This projection involves the use of parameters W\ud835\udc5d\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f\\nandb\ud835\udc5d\u2208R\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, where\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3frepresents the commonly used hidden\\ndimension in language models (LLMs).\\nThe resulting projection, denoted as H\u2208R\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc39\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, are rep-\\nresented in the instructions using special tokens as: <ST_start>,\\n<ST_HIS>, ..., <ST_HIS>, <ST_end>. Here, <ST_start> and <ST_end>\\nserve as identifiers marking the beginning and end of the spatio-\\ntemporal token. These identifiers can be included in the large-\\nscale language model by expanding its vocabulary. The placeholder\\n<ST_HIS> represents the spatio-temporal token and corresponds to\\nthe projection Hin the hidden layer. By employing this technique,\\nthe model gains the ability to discern spatio-temporal dependen-\\ncies, thereby enhancing its proficiency in successfully performing\\nspatio-temporal predictive tasks within urban scenes.\\n3.2.2 Spatio-Temporal Prompt Instructions. In scenarios in-\\nvolving spatio-temporal prediction, both temporal and spatial in-\\nformation contain valuable semantic details that contribute to the\\nmodel\u2019s understanding of spatio-temporal patterns within specific\\ncontexts. For instance, traffic flow in the early morning differs sig-\\nnificantly from rush hour, and there are variations in traffic patterns\\nbetween commercial and residential areas. As a result, we recognize\\nthe potential of representing both temporal and spatial information\\nas prompt instruction text. We leverage the text understanding\\ncapabilities of large language models to encode this information,\\nenabling associative reasoning for downstream tasks.\\nIn our UrbanGPT framework, we integrate multi-granularity\\ntime information and spatial details as instruction inputs for the\\nlarge language model. Time information includes factors such as\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 4\\n\\nl = 1l = 2l = 3\\nGateSpatio -Temporal dependenc yencoder\\nLLMs spaceLightweight alignment moduleSpatio -Temporal Instruction -Tuning\\nGiven the historical data and the corresponding tokens\\n<ST_HIS> fortaxi flow \u2026The recording time \u2026This region\\nislocated \u2026Please generate thepredictive tokens for\u2026\\nBased onthe given information, the predictive tokens\\noftaxi inflow and outflow inthis region are<ST_PRE> \u2026\\nLarge Language Models\\nInflow\uff1a[28 26 20 33 49  50 48 34 40 22 \u2026]\\nOutflow\uff1a[40 52 58 32 22 10 18 19 20 24\u2026]City A\\nCity B\\n\u2026\\nInstruction -Tuning Zero -shot prediction\\n<ST_HIS> <ST_HIS> Multi -tasks\\nRegression Layer<ST_HIS> <ST_ PRE> \\ntokens\\nText Replacement\\nLlama VicunaAlignment\\nRegressionST Encoder\\nTask assignment\\nText instructionsInstructions\\nResponsesRegion A\\nRegion B\\nFrozen Trainable\\n\u2026\\nSpatio -Temporal Zero -shot prediction\\nTrain city\\nTest cityTrain region\\nTest region\\nST dependency representations ST Instruction -Tuning of LLMsFigure 2: The overall architecture of the proposed spatio-temporal language model UrbanGPT.\\nTemporal Information :The recording time ofthehistorical data is'January 7,2020 ,08:30,\\nTuesday toJanuary 7,2020 ,14:00,Tuesday, with data points recorded at30-minute intervals' .\\nSpatial Information :Here istheregion information :This region islocated within theStaten\\nIsland borough district and encompasses various POIs within athree -kilometer radius,\\ncovering Public Safety, Education Facility, Residential categories .\\nTask description :Now wewant topredict thetaxi inflow and outflow forthenext 12time\\nsteps during thetime period of'January 7,2020 ,14:30,Tuesday toJanuary 7,2020 ,20:00,\\nTuesday, with data points recorded at30-minute intervals' .\\nFigure 3: Illustration of spatio-temporal prompt instructions\\nencoding the time- and location-aware information.\\nthe day of the week and the hour of the day, while regional in-\\nformation encompasses the city, administrative areas, and nearby\\npoints of interest (POI) data, among others.

This enables the model to encapsulate these insights within\\ncomplex spatio-temporal contexts, thereby enhancing its ability\\nfor zero-shot reasoning. The design of the instructional text for\\nspatio-temporal information is illustrated in Figure 3.\\n3.2.3 Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning of LLMs. When\\nit comes to incorporating detailed spatio-temporal textual descrip-\\ntions, the next stage is to fine-tune large language models (LLMs)\\nusing instructions to generate spatio-temporal forecasts in textual\\nformat. However, this approach poses two challenges. Firstly , spatio-\\ntemporal forecasting typically relies on numerical data, which dif-\\nfers in structure and patterns from natural language that language\\nmodels excel at processing, focusing on semantic and syntactic rela-\\ntionships. Secondly , large language models are typically pre-trained\\nusing a multi-classification loss to predict vocabulary, resulting in a\\nprobability distribution of potential outcomes. This contrasts with\\nthe continuous value distribution required for regression tasks.\\nTo address these challenges, UrbanGPT adopts a different strat-\\negy by refraining from directly predicting future spatio-temporal\\nvalues. Instead, it generates forecasting tokens that aid in the pre-\\ndiction process. These tokens are subsequently passed through a\\nregression layer, which maps the hidden representations to generate\\nmore accurate predictive values. The formulation of the regressionlayer in our spatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm is:\\n\u02c6Y\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53=W3[\ud835\udf0e(W1H\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53),\ud835\udf0e(W2\u0393\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53)] (5)\\nThe prediction result, denoted as \u02c6Y\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53\u2208R\ud835\udc43, is obtained using the\\nrectified linear unit activation function, represented by \ud835\udf0e. The hid-\\nden representations of the forecasting tokens, denoted as \u0393\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53\u2208\\nR\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, are introduced as a novel term in the vocabulary of large lan-\\nguage models (LLMs). The regression layer is formulated using\\nweight matrices W1\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f,W2\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, and W3\u2208R\ud835\udc43\u00d72\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n,\\nwhere[\u00b7,\u00b7]represents the concatenation operation. While the prob-\\nability distribution of the forecasting tokens remains relatively\\nstable, their hidden representations contain rich spatio-temporal\\ncontextual attributes that capture dynamic spatio-temporal interde-\\npendencies. This enables our model to provide precise predictions\\nby leveraging this contextual information.\\n3.3 Model Optimization\\nBuilding upon the baseline model [ 1,8], we adopt the absolute error\\nloss as our regression loss function. This choice allows us to effec-\\ntively handle predictions across a wide range of urban scenarios.\\nAdditionally, we introduce a classification loss as a joint loss to\\ncater to diverse task requirements. To ensure optimal performance,\\nour model optimizes different losses based on the specific task in-\\nputs. For instance, we utilize the regression loss for tasks such as\\ntraffic flow prediction, while employing the classification loss for\\ntasks like crime prediction. This approach enables our model to\\neffectively address the unique challenges posed by each task and\\ndeliver accurate predictions in various urban scenarios.\\nL\ud835\udc50=\u22121\\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01\\n\ud835\udc56=1[\ud835\udeff(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)\u00b7log(\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)+(1\u2212\ud835\udeff(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56))\u00b7log(1\u2212\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)]\\nL\ud835\udc5f=1\\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01\\n\ud835\udc56=1|\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\u2212\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56|;L=L\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc60+L\ud835\udc5f+L\ud835\udc50 (6)\\nHere,\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56represents a sample from \u02c6Y, and\ud835\udc41represents the total\\nnumber of samples, which is calculated as the product of \ud835\udc45,\ud835\udc47, and\\n\ud835\udc39. We use various loss functions in our model, including L\ud835\udc50for\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 5\\n\\nbinary cross-entropy loss, L\ud835\udc5ffor regression loss, and the cross-\\nentropy loss adopted in our spatio-temporal language models. To\\ncapture probability distributions from the prediction, we employ\\nthe sigmoid function denoted by \ud835\udeff. Each of these loss functions\\nplays a specific role in our model, allowing us to effectively handle\\nclassification, regression, and language modeling tasks as needed.\\n4 EVALUATION\\nIn this section, we aim to assess the capabilities of our proposed\\nmodel across various settings by addressing five key questions:\\n\u2022RQ1 : What is the performance and generalization capability of\\nUrbanGPT in diverse zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction tasks?\\n\u2022RQ2 : How does UrbanGPT perform when compared to existing\\nspatio-temporal models in classical supervised scenarios?\\n\u2022RQ3 : What specific contributions do the proposed key compo-\\nnents bring to enhance the capabilities of our UrbanGPT model?\\n\u2022RQ4 : Can the proposed model robustly handle the forecasting\\nscenarios with varying spatio-temporal patterns?\\n4.1 Experimental Setting\\n4.1.1 Dataset Description. To evaluate the effectiveness of the\\nproposed model in predicting spatio-temporal patterns across var-\\nious urban computing scenarios, we conducted experiments us-\\ning four distinct datasets: NYC-taxi, NYC-bike, NYC-crime, and\\nCHI-taxi. These datasets encompass a wide range of data sources\\nto capture the dynamic nature of urban environments, including\\nrecords of taxi travel, bike trajectories, crime incidents in New York\\nCity, and taxi travel data in Chicago. To facilitate our analysis, we\\npartitioned the cities into grid-like regions based on latitude and\\nlongitude information. Within specific time intervals, we aggre-\\ngated statistical measures for each region. For example, this in-\\nvolved calculating the number of taxi inflows and outflows within\\na 30-minute period in region A, or determining the count of theft\\nincidents within a day in region B. Furthermore, Points of Interest\\n(POIs) data can be obtained through APIs provided by map services,\\nutilizing the latitude and longitude of different regions. For more\\ncomprehensive data descriptions, please refer to the Appendix.\\n4.1.2 Evaluation Protocols. In order to investigate the capabili-\\nties of large language models in analyzing diverse spatio-temporal\\ndata across different regions, we selected a subset of taxi, bike, and\\ncrime data from various areas of New York City as our training set.\\n\u2022Zero-Shot Learning Scenarios . We assessed the model perfor-\\nmance by predicting future spatio-temporal data from regions in\\nNYC or even Chicago that were unseen in the training phase.\\n\u2022Supervised Learning Scenarios . We evaluated the model using\\nfuture data from the same regions as the training set.\\nFor regression tasks, we maintained a consistent training and test-\\ning methodology across all baseline models. When it came to classi-\\nfication tasks involving crime data, we utilized binary cross-entropy\\nas the loss function for training and testing the models. Our ex-\\nperiments were conducted using the robust vicuna-7b [ 50] as the\\nfoundational large language model for UrbanGPT. For a more com-\\nprehensive understanding of our methodology and experimental\\nsetup, please refer to the appendix for detailed information.4.1.3 Evaluation Metrics. For regression tasks, we employed\\nMAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)\\nas evaluation metrics. These metrics quantify the discrepancies\\nbetween the predicted outcomes and the actual labels, with lower\\nvalues indicating superior performance [ 12,49]. In the case of clas-\\nsification tasks, we utilized Recall and Macro-F1 as evaluation met-\\nrics to assess performance. Recall measures the model\u2019s ability to\\ncorrectly identify positive instances, while Macro-F1 is a compre-\\nhensive performance metric that combines precision and recall to\\nprovide an overall measure of classification accuracy [11, 30].\\n4.1.4 Baseline Model. We conducted a thorough comparison\\nwith 10 advanced models to establish baselines for our proposed\\nmethod. (i)In the category of RNNs-based spatio-temporal forecast-\\ning methods, we compared our proposed method with AGCRN [ 1],\\nDMVSTNET [ 39] and ST-LSTM [ 33]. These approaches leverage\\nRNNs for modeling and prediction. (ii)The GNNs-based spatio-\\ntemporal models primarily utilize graph neural networks to cap-\\nture spatial correlations and integrate temporal encoders to capture\\nspatio-temporal relationships. The models we compared against\\nin this category include GWN [ 37], MTGNN [ 36], STSGCN [ 26],\\nTGCN [ 47], and STGCN [ 42].(iii) In the attention-based spatio-\\ntemporal models category, the methods employ attention mecha-\\nnisms to model spatio-temporal correlations. The models we com-\\npared against in this category are ASTGCN [8] and STWA [5].\\n4.2 Zero-Shot Prediction Performance (RQ1)\\nIn this section, we thoroughly evaluate the predictive performance\\nof our proposed model in zero-shot scenarios. The results of our\\nevaluation are presented in Table 1 and visualized in Figure 4. Our\\nobjective is to assess the model\u2019s effectiveness in predicting spatio-\\ntemporal patterns in geographical areas that it has not encountered\\nduring training. This evaluation encompasses both cross-region\\nand cross-city settings, allowing us to gain insights into the model\u2019s\\ngeneralization capabilities across different locations.\\n4.2.1 Prediction on Unseen Regions within a City. Cross-\\nregion scenarios entail using data from certain regions within a\\ncity to forecast future conditions in other regions that have not\\nbeen encountered by the model. Through a thorough analysis of\\nthe model\u2019s performance in these cross-region predictions, we can\\ndraw attention to three significant observations:\\ni) Superior Zero-shot Predictive Performance . The results pre-\\nsented in Table 1 highlight the exceptional performance of our\\nproposed model in both regression and classification tasks on vari-\\nous datasets, surpassing the baseline models in zero-shot prediction.\\nThe success of our model can be attributed to two key factors.\\n\u2022Spatio-Temporal-Text-Alignment . The alignment of spatio-\\ntemporal contextual signals with the text comprehension abil-\\nities of language models plays a pivotal role in the success of\\nour proposed model. This fusion enables the model to effectively\\ncapitalize on both the encoded urban dynamics from the spa-\\ntiotemporal signals and the comprehensive understanding of\\ntextual context provided by the LLMs. By leveraging these two\\nessential aspects, our model achieves the remarkable ability to\\ngeneralize its prediction capabilities in zero-shot scenarios.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 6\\n\\nTable 1: Our model\u2019s performance in zero-shot prediction is evaluated on three diverse datasets: NYC-taxi, NYC-bike, and\\nNYC-crime, providing a comprehensive assessment of its predictive capabilities in unseen situations.\\nModelDataset NYC-taxi NYC-bike NYC-crime\\nType Inflow Outflow Inflow Outflow Burglary Robbery\\nMetrics MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE Macro-F1 Recall Macro-F1 Recall\\nAGCRN 10.86 26.51 13.15 36.45 3.41 7.98 3.42 8.08 0.48 0.00 0.49 0.01\\nASTGCN 9.75 24.12 12.42 33.28 5.58 11.58 5.78 12.29 0.49 0.01 0.55 0.09\\nGWN 10.73 26.50 9.67 26.74 3.32 8.17 3.07 7.52 0.48 0.00 0.52 0.04\\nMTGNN 10.16 25.84 12.59 35.38 3.18 7.62 3.20 7.65 0.64 0.27 0.65 0.30\\nSTWA 11.28 28.97 13.54 38.61 4.59 10.94 4.35 10.67 0.48 0.00 0.51 0.03\\nSTSGCN 18.97 41.38 20.07 45.79 6.85 14.98 6.54 14.77 0.48 0.00 0.48 0.00\\nSTGCN 12.54 30.80 14.32 39.58 4.11 9.21 4.45 9.62 0.48 0.00 0.64 0.30\\nTGCN 10.04 25.10 10.98 30.03 2.88 6.55 2.91 6.42 0.56 0.10 0.58 0.13\\nDMVSTNET 11.00 28.29 10.59 29.20 3.80 9.87 3.65 9.21 0.48 0.01 0.59 0.15\\nST-LSTM 16.97 34.43 18.93 44.10 7.78 15.41 6.92 17.12 0.48 0.00 0.49 0.03\\nUrbanGPT 6.16 16.92 6.83 21.78 2.02 5.16 2.01 5.03 0.67 0.34 0.69 0.42\\n\u2022Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning . This adaptive tuning\\nprocess empowers the LLM to effectively integrate crucial in-\\nformation from the instructions, enhancing its comprehension\\nof the complex relationships and dependencies between spatial\\nand temporal factors. By seamlessly merging the spatio-temporal\\ninstruction-tuning with the spatio-temporal dependency encoder,\\nour proposed model, UrbanGPT, successfully preserves universal\\nand transferable spatio-temporal knowledge. Consequently, the\\nmodel becomes capable of capturing the fundamental patterns\\nand dynamics that govern spatio-temporal phenomena, enabling\\nit to make precise predictions in downstream zero-shot scenarios.\\nii) Enhanced Urban Semantic Understanding . Urban seman-\\ntics offer valuable insights into the diverse dimensions of spatial\\nand temporal characteristics. Our approach involves training our\\nmodel on a wide range of datasets, enriching its understanding\\nof spatio-temporal dynamics across different timeframes and geo-\\ngraphical locations. In contrast, baseline models tend to prioritize\\nencoding temporal and spatial dependencies, neglecting the nu-\\nanced semantics that differentiate regions, timeframes, and data\\ncategories. By incorporating comprehensive semantic awareness\\ninto our UrbanGPT, we significantly enhance its ability to make\\naccurate zero-shot predictions in previously unseen regions.\\niii) Improved Performance in Sparse Data Scenarios . Predict-\\ning spatio-temporal patterns in sparse data environments is chal-\\nlenging as models tend to overfit when data points are scarce. This\\nchallenge is particularly notable when predicting crimes, where data\\nis often sparse but crucial for accurate predictions. Baseline mod-\\nels struggle in cross-regional prediction tasks under these sparse\\nconditions, resulting in low recall scores that indicate potential over-\\nfitting. To overcome this limitation, our model integrates spatio-\\ntemporal learning with large language models (LLMs) using an\\neffective spatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm. By incorpo-\\nrating rich semantic insights, our approach enhances the model\u2019s\\nspatio-temporal representations, enabling it to effectively handle\\nsparse data and achieve improved prediction accuracy.\\n4.2.2 Cross-City Prediction Task. To assess the performance of\\nour model in cross-city prediction tasks, we conducted tests on the\\nCHI-taxi dataset, which was not seen during the training phase. The\\nresults, depicted in Figure 4, yielded the following observations:\u2022Consistency in Multi-step Prediction : Our model consistently\\noutperforms the comparison method at each time step. Notably,\\nit maintains a significant advantage in both short-term and long-\\nterm spatio-temporal prediction, demonstrating the robustness\\nof our proposed model in cross-city prediction scenarios.\\n\u2022Effective Knowledge Transfer Across Cities : The prediction\\nresults obtained from the CHI-taxi dataset validate the supe-\\nrior forecasting capabilities of our model in cross-city scenarios.\\nThis enhancement can be attributed to the integration of spatio-\\ntemporal encoders with the spatio-temporal instruction-tuning\\nparadigm. By incorporating these components, our model ef-\\nfectively captures universal and transferable spatio-temporal\\npatterns, allowing it to make accurate predictions. Additionally,\\nby considering different geographical information and temporal\\nfactors alongside the learned transferred knowledge, our model\\nsuccessfully associates spatio-temporal patterns exhibited by\\nsimilar functional areas and historical periods. This comprehen-\\nsive understanding provides valuable insights for making precise\\nzero-shot predictions in cross-city scenarios.\\n4.3 Classical Supervised Prediction Task (RQ2)\\nThis section examines the predictive capabilities of our UrbanGPT\\nin end-to-end supervised prediction scenarios, as presented in Ta-\\nble 2. We will discuss the results from two perspectives below.\\nEnhanced Long-Term Forecasting Abilities : We examined the\\nmodel\u2019s effectiveness in long-term spatio-temporal forecasting by\\nutilizing test datasets that spanned broader time intervals. For in-\\nstance, we trained the model using data from 2017 and evaluated its\\nperformance on data from 2021. The results of these experiments\\ndemonstrate that our UrbanGPT possesses a significant advantage\\nover the baselines, highlighting its superior ability to generalize\\nacross different temporal landscapes. This capability reduces the\\nneed for frequent retraining or incremental updates, making the\\nmodel more aligned with real-world applications. Additionally, the\\nexperiments have confirmed that incorporating additional textual\\nknowledge does not hinder model performance or introduce noise,\\nthus further validating the feasibility of utilizing large language\\nmodels to enhance spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.\\nSpatial Semantic Understanding : Accurately capturing spatial\\ncorrelations is crucial in the realm of spatio-temporal prediction.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 7\\n\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon23456 MAE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOurs\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon3456789101112131415 RMSE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOurs\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon12345 MAE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOurs\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon456789101112131415 RMSE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOursFigure 4: Time step-based prediction comparison experiment conducted on the CHI-taxi dataset.\\nTable 2: Evaluation of performance in the end-to-end super-\\nvised setting on the NYC-taxi and NYC-bike datasets.\\nModelNYC-taxi NYC-bike\\nInflow Outflow Inflow Outflow\\nMAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE\\nAGCRN 2.83 8.35 2.62 9.21 3.30 7.65 3.38 7.73\\nASTGCN 5.41 18.04 5.00 19.29 3.87 7.93 3.66 7.69\\nGWN 3.91 11.93 2.89 10.85 4.30 9.04 3.88 8.29\\nMTGNN 3.09 10.13 2.61 10.96 3.31 7.47 3.26 7.61\\nSTWA 3.90 12.64 3.15 11.32 4.23 9.07 4.18 9.18\\nSTSGCN 4.57 13.93 4.41 15.87 5.10 12.23 4.72 10.78\\nSTGCN 3.45 9.82 3.17 10.53 3.88 9.23 3.90 9.08\\nTGCN 3.99 11.47 3.31 11.58 4.12 7.92 4.11 7.84\\nDMVSTNET 3.83 11.55 2.76 9.88 3.71 7.95 3.69 7.92\\nST-LSTM 7.78 15.41 6.92 17.12 5.00 11.52 4.96 11.41\\nUrbanGPT 2.50 6.78 1.71 6.68 3.11 7.10 3.01 6.94\\nTraditional methods often employ graph networks or attention\\nmechanisms to analyze these correlations.

This approach enables the model to comprehend the\\nshared characteristics of areas with similar functions at a higher\\nsemantic level. Consequently, it deduces patterns of correlation\\nbetween various functional zones and effectively represents the\\ninterconnections among different regions.\\n4.4 Ablation study (RQ3)\\nThis section investigates the impact of different key components\\non the performance of our model, as illustrated in Figure 5. Our\\nrigorous testing primarily revolves around the zero-shot scenario\\nusing the NYC-taxi dataset. Through our analysis, we have distilled\\nthe benefits offered by the different modules into four key points.\\n\u2022(1) Impact of Spatial and Temporal Context :-STC . By re-\\nmoving time and spatial information from the instruction text,\\nwe observed a noticeable decline in the model\u2019s performance.\\nThis can be attributed to the lack of temporal information, forcing\\nthe model to rely solely on spatio-temporal encoders for encoding\\ntime-related features and performing prediction tasks. Furthermore,\\nthe absence of spatial information hindered the model\u2019s ability to\\ncapture spatial correlations, making it challenging to analyze the\\ndistinct spatio-temporal patterns of different areas.\\n\u2022(2) Impact of Instruction-Tuning with Diverse Datasets :-\\nMulti .

As a result, the model\u2019s per-\\nformance was suboptimal. By integrating diverse spatio-temporal\\ndata from multiple sources, our model can effectively capture the\\nunique characteristics of different geographical locations and their\\nevolving spatio-temporal patterns.\\n\u2022(3) Impact of Spatio-Temporal Encoder :-STE . In this vari-\\nant, we disable the spatio-temporal encoder to investigate its\\neffect on aligning the large language model with encoded urban\\ndependency dynamics into latent embedding space.\\nThe results clearly indicate that the absence of the spatio-temporal\\nencoder significantly hampers the performance of the large lan-\\nguage model in spatio-temporal prediction scenarios. This under-\\nscores the crucial role played by the proposed spatio-temporal\\nencoder in enhancing the model\u2019s predictive capabilities.\\n\u2022(4) Regression Layer Incorporation in Instruction-Tuning:\\nT2P. We explicitly instructed UrbanGPT to generate its predic-\\ntions in a textual format. However, the suboptimal performance\\nindicates the challenges in utilizing LLMs for precise numerical\\nregression tasks, as opposed to employing regression layers.\\nThe primary challenge stems from the model\u2019s dependence on\\nmulti-class loss for optimization during training, leading to a mis-\\nmatch between the model\u2019s probabilistic output and the continuous\\nvalue distribution necessary for spatio-temporal forecasting. To\\nbridge this gap, we incorporated a regression predictor into our\\nmodel, significantly improving its capacity to generate more precise\\nnumerical predictions for regression tasks.\\n4.5 Model Robustness Study (RQ4)\\nIn this section, we focus on evaluating the robustness of our Ur-\\nbanGPT across different spatio-temporal pattern scenarios. We cate-\\ngorize regions based on the magnitude of numerical variations, such\\nas taxi flow, during a specific time period.

Deep spatio-temporal\\nprediction methods have gained prominence in deep learning due\\nto their impressive performance. These models typically consist of\\ntwo components: temporal dependency modeling and spatial corre-\\nlation encoding. Early models like D-LSTM [ 43] and ST-resnet [ 45]\\nused RNNs and convolutional networks to model temporal and\\nspatial dependencies. Graph neural networks (GNNs) proved to\\nbe a natural fit for spatial correlation modeling, as seen in models\\nlike STGCN [ 42] and DCRNN [ 14], which utilized graph structures\\nbased on node distances. Techniques such as learnable region-wise\\ngraph structures [ 36,37] and dynamic spatio-temporal graph net-\\nworks [9, 48] have further enhanced spatial correlation modeling.\\nFurthermore, researchers have explored approaches such as\\nmulti-scale temporal learning [ 34] and multi-granularity tempo-\\nral learning [ 8] to encode temporal dependencies.

In\\nthis work, we address the challenge of data scarcity in downstream\\nurban scenarios by proposing UrbanGPT. Our model demonstrates\\nthe ability to generalize well across various scenarios, mitigating\\nthe need for extensive training or fine-tuning on target data.\\nLarge Language Models. The emergence of large language mod-\\nels [3,21] has recently attracted significant attention due to their\\nunprecedented machine performance in tasks like text understand-\\ning and reasoning. These models have become a hot topic, demon-\\nstrating the potential to advance from intelligent algorithms to\\nartificial intelligence. Open-source large language models such as\\nLlama [ 28,29], Vicuna [ 50], and ChatGLM [ 44] have been released,\\nleading to researchers exploring their application in various fields\\nto enhance transfer learning capabilities with domain knowledge\\nfrom these models. In the computer vision domain, researchers\\nhave combined multimodal large language models with prompt\\nlearning methods to achieve zero-shot predictions in downstream\\ntasks [ 25,51,52]. Furthermore, the capabilities of LLMs in graph\\nreasoning [ 2,4,27], recommendation [ 10,23,35] and traffic anal-\\nysis [ 6] have been extensively studied. However, the utilization\\nof large language models for zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction\\ntasks in the field of urban intelligence remains largely unexplored.\\n6 CONCLUSION\\nWe present the UrbanGPT, a spatio-temporal large language model,\\nto generalize well in diverse urban scenarios. To seamlessly align\\nthe spatio-temporal contextual signals with LLMs, we introduce a\\nspatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm. This empowers the\\nUrbanGPT with the remarkable ability to learn universal and trans-\\nferable spatio-temporal patterns across various types of urban data.\\nThrough extensive experiments and meticulous ablation studies,\\nwe demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of the UrbanGPT\u2019s\\narchitecture and its key components. However, it is important to\\nacknowledge that while the results are promising, there are still\\nlimitations to be addressed in future studies. As a first step, we are\\nactively engaged in collecting a more diverse range of urban data\\nto enhance and refine the capabilities of our UrbanGPT across a\\nbroader spectrum of urban computing domains. Additionally, un-\\nderstanding the decision-making process of our UrbanGPT is of im-\\nportance. While the model demonstrates exceptional performance,\\nproviding interpretability and explainability is equally essential.\\nFuture research efforts will focus on empowering our model with\\nthe ability to interpret and explain its predictions.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 9\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n[1]Lei Bai, Lina Yao, Can Li, Xianzhi Wang, and Can Wang. 2020.

This includes detailed dataset informa-\\ntion, hyperparameter configuration, experimental setting for the\\ninstruction-tuning phase and test phase, as well as the baselines.\\nFurthermore, we present a case study of our UrbanGPT, showcasing\\nits effectiveness for zero-shot spatio-temporal predictions.\\nA.1 Experimental Details Description\\nA.1.1 Dataset Details. We collected data on taxi flows, bicycle\\nflows, and crime incidents in New York City for training and evalu-\\nation. The NYC-taxi dataset contains 263 regions, with each region\\nmeasuring approximately 3km x 3km. The time sampling inter-\\nval for this dataset is 30 minutes. The NYC-bike and NYC-crime\\ndatasets consist of 2162 regions, each represented by a 1km x 1km\\ngrid. The time sampling interval for NYC-bike is also 30 minutes,\\nwhile for NYC-crime, it is 1 day. All datasets cover the time period\\nfrom Jan 1, 2016, to Dec 31, 2021, in NYC. The CHI-taxi dataset\\nincludes 77 regions, with each region measuring approximately\\n4km x 4km. This dataset includes all taxi data from January 1, 2021,\\nto December 31, 2021, with a time sampling interval of 30 minutes.\\nA.1.2 Hyperparameters Settings. The parameters for the di-\\nlation convolution kernel in the time encoder are set as follows:\\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b,\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61, and\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61are all set to 32, with a dilation factor of 1. For\\nour prediction task, we aim to predict the next 12 steps of data\\nbased on the previous 12 steps. Both the history length ( \ud835\udc3b) and\\nprediction length ( \ud835\udc43) are set to 12. The projection layer parameters\\nare configured with \ud835\udc51set to 64 and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3fset to 4096. Lastly, the hidden\\nlayer parameter \ud835\udc51\u2032for the regression layer is set to 128.\\nA.1.3 Further Experimental Setup Descriptions. During the\\ninstruction-tuning phase, we randomly selected 80 regions from\\nthe three datasets in New York City as training data. It\u2019s important\\nto note that the region indices were kept consistent for the NYC-\\nbike and NYC-crime datasets. The training sets had specific time\\nintervals: for NYC-taxi datasets, it ranged from January 1, 2017,\\nto March 31, 2017; for NYC-bike datasets, it covered April 1, 2017,\\nto June 30, 2017; and for NYC-crime datasets, it spanned from\\nJanuary 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018. For the pretraining of the\\nspatio-temporal dependency encoder and the baseline models, we\\nutilized the same data for training to optimize the parameters. The\\nmaximum epoch count was set at 100. In the testing phase, we\\nconducted the following evaluations:\\n\u2022(i)Zero-Shot Prediction . We also selected an additional 80\\nregions from the New York City datasets as unseen test data. For\\nthe NYC-bike and NYC-taxi datasets, we used the first two weeks\\nof data in 2020 for testing. As for the NYC-crime dataset, we used\\nthe entire year of 2020 for testing. In the case of the Chicago city\\ndataset, we evaluated the model using all the data from Dec 2021.\\n\u2022(ii)Classical Supervised Prediction : For evaluation purposes,\\nwe chose the data with the longest time interval, which involved\\ntesting the model using all the data from the NYC-bike and NYC-\\ntaxi datasets specifically for the month of December 2021.\\nA.1.4 Baseline Details. To facilitate our discussion, we have\\ncategorized all the baselines into three distinct categories: RNN-\\nbased models, attention-based models, and graph neural network(GNN)-based spatio-temporal prediction models. Below, we provide\\ndetailed descriptions of each baseline category:\\nRNN-based Spatio-Temporal Methods:\\n\u2022ST-LSTM [33]: It incorporates the Long Short-Term Memory to\\ncapture temporal dependencies in the spatio-temporal data.\\n\u2022AGCRN [1]: RNNs are employed to capture temporal correlations,\\nallowing for the representation of the evolving patterns over time.\\n\u2022DMVSTNET [39]: In this method, RNNs are utilized to effectively\\nmodel temporal dependencies, capturing the patterns that evolve\\nover time. Furthermore, convolutional networks and fully con-\\nnected layers are employed to capture local spatial correlations\\nand establish meaningful spatial relationships.\\nAttention-based Spatio-Temporal Approaches:\\n\u2022ASTGCN [8]: In this method, attention mechanisms are employed\\nto capture multi-granularity temporal correlation features.\\n\u2022STWA [5]: The model incorporates personalized temporal and\\nspatial parameters into the attention module, allowing for the\\nmodeling of dynamic spatio-temporal correlations.\\nSpatio-Temporal GNNs:\\n\u2022GWN [37]: It incorporates a learnable graph structure and 1-D\\nconvolutions to effectively learn spatio-temporal dependencies.\\n\u2022MTGNN [36]: It utilizes a learnable graph structure to model\\nmultivariate temporal correlations. MTGNN employs 1-D dilation\\nconvolutions to generate temporal representations.\\n\u2022TGCN [47]: This model combines graph neural networks (GNNs)\\nfor spatial correlation modeling and recurrent neural networks\\n(RNNs) for temporal correlation modeling.\\n\u2022STGCN [42]: It uses gated temporal convolutions and GNNs to\\nmodel temporal and spatial dependencies, respectively.\\n\u2022STSGCN [26]: It introduces a spatio-temporal graph construction\\nto learn spatial correlations across adjacent time steps.\\nA.2 Case study\\nIn this section, we assess the effectiveness of different large lan-\\nguage models (LLMs) in zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction sce-\\nnarios, as illustrated in Table 3 and Table 4. The instructions pro-\\nvided to the models are clearly indicated in blue font. The results\\ndemonstrate that various LLMs are capable of generating predic-\\ntions based on these instructions, thereby highlighting the effective-\\nness of the prompt design. For instance, ChatGPT relies on historical\\naverages rather than explicitly incorporating temporal or spatial\\ndata in its predictions. Llama-2-70b analyzes specific time periods\\nand regions, but it encounters challenges in encoding numerical\\ntime-series dependencies, resulting in suboptimal predictive perfor-\\nmance. On the other hand, Claude-2.1 effectively summarizes and\\nanalyzes historical data, leveraging peak-hour patterns and points\\nof interest to achieve more accurate traffic trend predictions.\\nOur proposed UrbanGPT seamlessly integrates spatio-temporal\\ncontextual signals with the reasoning capabilities of large language\\nmodels (LLMs) through a spatio-temporal instruction-tuning para-\\ndigm. This integration leads to remarkable improvements in predict-\\ning numerical values and spatio-temporal trends. These findings\\nunderscore the potential and effectiveness of our framework in\\ncapturing universal spatio-temporal patterns, making zero-shot\\nspatio-temporal prediction practical and achievable.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 11\\n\\nTable 3: We examine the zero-shot predictions of different LLMs for bicycle flow in NYC with the provided instructions.\\nInstructions: Given the historical data for bike flow over 12 time steps in a specific region of New York City, the recorded bike inflows\\nare [12 8 9 15 10 12 14 9 6 12 25 20], and the recorded bike outflows are [5 12 12 15 10 11 6 9 4 6 10 15]. The recording time of the\\nhistorical data is \u2019January 14, 2020, 12:00, Tuesday to January 14, 2020, 17:30, Tuesday, with data points recorded at 30-minute intervals\u2019.\\nHere is the region information: This region is located within the Staten Island borough district and encompasses various POIs within a\\none-kilometer radius, covering Education Facility, Cultural Facility, Commercial, Transportation Facility categories. We now aim to\\npredict the bike inflow and outflow for the next 12 time steps during the time period of \u2019January 14, 2020, 18:00, Tuesday to January 14,\\n2020, 23:30, Tuesday, with data points recorded at 30-minute intervals\u2019. To improve prediction accuracy, a spatio-temporal model is\\nutilized to encode the historical bike data as tokens <ST_Start><ST_HIS><ST_HIS><ST_End>, where the first and the second tokens\\ncorrespond to the representations of bike inflow and outflow. Please conduct an analysis of the traffic patterns in this region, taking into\\naccount the provided time and regional information, and then generate the predictions (the predictive tokens for regression).\\nGround true: Based on the given information, the predictions of bike inflow and outflow in this region are [26 38 28 24 20 13 16 9 5 3\\n5 2] and[12 19 10 10 11 9 6 5 4 4 2 2] .\\nLlama-2-70b Responds: Based on the provided historical data, I have ...

Predicted Bike Outflow: [9.58 9.58... 9.58] ...\\nClaude-2.1 Responds: Based on the provided historical data, this region in Staten Island seems to experience fluctuating yet relatively\\nlow bike traffic flow during the daytime on Tuesdays. The bike inflows range from 6 to 15 per 30-minute interval, while outflows range\\nfrom 4 to 15.Given the region covers education, cultural, commercial, and transportation facilities within a 1km radius, the bike traffic\\nlikely corresponds to people traveling to and from these points of interest. The fluctuations could reflect class/work schedules and\\ntransportation needs throughout the day.For the evening prediction period of 6PM to 11:30PM, we may expect some further fluctuations\\nbut generally declining bike traffic as the day turns to night. People would be finishing up activities and heading home. I would predict\\nthe following bike inflows and outflows for the next 12 time steps: [10 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 1 1] and[8 6 5 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 1 1] ...\\nUrbanGPT Responds: Based on the given information, the predictions (predicted tokens) of bike inflow and outflow in this region are\\n<ST_PRE> [20 21 22 21 17 12 9 7 6 5 5 5] and <ST_PRE> [11 10 8 7 6 6 5 4 4 3 3 2] .\\nTable 4: Zero-shot predictions of different LLMs for taxi flow in NYC with the provided instructions (without spatial information).\\nInstructions: Given the historical data for taxi flow over 12 time steps in a specific region of New York City, the recorded taxi inflows\\nare [111 86 90 78 49 75 46 32 20 14 9 9], and the recorded taxi outflows are [100 91 58 39 47 47 19 22 21 9 16 10].

This has significant implications in the field\\nof urban computing, where the ability to predict transportation\\npatterns can optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance\\noverall urban mobility [ 18,31]. Moreover, anticipating population\\nmovement can aid in effective urban planning and resource alloca-\\ntion [ 7,20]. Additionally, the ability to forecast crimes can greatly\\ncontribute to enhancing public safety [ 32]. Spatio-temporal predic-\\ntion plays a vital role in shaping smarter and more efficient cities,\\nultimately leading to an improved quality of urban life.\\nIt is important to highlight the various types of neural network\\narchitectures commonly adopted in this domain of spatio-temporal\\nprediction. These architectures are designed to capture and model\\nthe complex relationships between spatial and temporal dimensions\\nin the data. One widely employed architecture is the Convolutional\\nNeural Network (CNN) [ 15,39,45], which is effective in extract-\\ning spatial features by applying convolutional filters across the\\ninput data. Another line of spatio-temporal neural networks is the\\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) family [ 1,34,43]. Those spatio-\\ntemporal RNNs are well-suited for capturing temporal dependencies\\nby maintaining a memory state that can retain information over\\ntime. Recently, there has been a surge in the use of Graph Neural\\nNetworks (GNNs) for spatio-temporal prediction [ 36,40,47]. GNNs\\nexcel in modeling complex spatial relationships in data represented\\nas graphs, where each node corresponds to a spatial location and\\nedges capture the connections between them.\\nWhile current spatio-temporal neural network techniques have\\nproven to be highly effective, it is crucial to acknowledge their\\nstrong dependence on having an abundance of labeled data in order\\nto generate accurate predictions. However, the pervasive problem\\nof data scarcity in practical urban sensing scenarios poses a sig-\\nnificant challenge. For example, deploying sensors throughout the\\nentire urban space to monitor citywide traffic volume or air qual-\\nity is impractical due to the high cost involved [ 17,41]. Moreover,\\nthe challenge of limited labeled data availability extends to spatio-\\ntemporal forecasting across different cities, in which acquiring\\nlabeled data for each target city becomes a daunting task [ 13,38].\\nThese issues emphasize the pressing need for novel solutions that\\naddress data scarcity and enhance the generalization capabilities of\\nspatio-temporal models in various smart city applications.\\nInspired by the remarkable progress of large language models\\n(LLMs), our primary goal is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that\\npossesses outstanding generalization capabilities across a wide\\narray of urban tasks.

These hurdles call for meticulous model\\ndesign to bridge the gap between the unique characteristics of\\nspatio-temporal data and the knowledge encoded within LLMs.\\nContributions . In light of these challenges, we propose UrbanGPT,\\na large language model specifically tailored for spatio-temporal\\nprediction. At the core of UrbanGPT lies a novel spatio-temporal\\ninstruction-tuning paradigm that seeks to align the intricate de-\\npendencies of time and space, with the knowledge space of LLMs.\\nWithin our UrbanGPT framework, we start by incorporating a\\nspatio-temporal dependency encoder, which utilizes a multi-level\\ntemporal convolutional network. This encoder enables the model\\nto capture the intricate temporal dynamics present in the spatio-\\ntemporal data across various time resolutions. Then, our model\\ninvolves aligning textual and spatio-temporal information to em-\\npower language models in effectively injecting spatio-temporal\\ncontextual signals. This is achieved through the utilization of a\\nlightweight alignment module that projects the representations\\nof spatio-temporal dependencies. The result is the generation of\\nmore expressive semantic representations by integrating valuable\\ninformation from both textual and spatio-temporal domains.\\nThrough the incorporation of spatio-temporal information dur-\\ning the instruction-tuning process, the language model gains profi-\\nciency in understanding and processing the intricate relationships\\nand patterns found in spatio-temporal data. By leveraging the in-\\nsights obtained from the spatio-temporal domain, the language\\nmodel becomes better equipped to capture the nuances and com-\\nplexities of spatio-temporal phenomena. This, in turn, enables the\\nmodel to make more reliable and insightful predictions across vari-\\nous urban scenarios, even when faced with limited data availability.\\nTo showcase the superior predictive performance of our pro-\\nposed model, we compare it with the large language model (LLaMA-\\n70B) and the spatio-temporal graph neural network (STGCN) in azero-shot traffic flow prediction scenario guided by textual instruc-\\ntions, as depicted in Figure 1. The large language model, LLaMA,\\neffectively infers traffic patterns from the input text. However, its\\nlimitations in handling numeric time-series data with complex spa-\\ntial and temporal dependencies can sometimes lead to opposite\\ntraffic trend predictions. On the other hand, the pre-trained base-\\nline model demonstrates a strong understanding of spatio-temporal\\ndependencies. However, it may suffer from overfitting to the source\\ndataset and underperform in zero-shot scenarios, indicating its lim-\\nited generalization capabilities beyond existing spatio-temporal\\nprediction models. In contrast, our proposed model achieves a har-\\nmonious integration of domain-specific spatio-temporal knowledge\\nand language modeling capabilities. This enables us to make more\\naccurate and reliable predictions under data scarcity.\\nIn summary, our main contributions can be outlined as follows:\\n\u2022To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop\\na spatio-temporal large language model capable of predicting\\ndiverse urban phenomena across different datasets, especially\\nunder conditions of limited data availability.\\n\u2022We propose UrbanGPT, a spatio-temporal prediction framework\\nthat empowers large language models (LLMs) to comprehend\\nthe intricate inter-dependencies across time and space. This is\\nachieved through the seamless integration of a spatio-temporal\\ndependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm, ef-\\nfectively aligning the spatio-temporal context with LLMs.\\n\u2022Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets\\nprovide compelling evidence of our proposed UrbanGPT\u2019s excep-\\ntional ability to generalize in zero-shot spatio-temporal learning\\nscenarios. These findings highlight the model\u2019s robust general-\\nization capacity, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately\\npredicting and understanding spatio-temporal patterns, even in\\nscenarios where no prior training data is available.\\n2 PRELIMINARIES\\nSpatio-Temporal Data . Spatio-temporal data is commonly col-\\nlected and can be represented as a three-dimensional tensor X\u2208\\nR\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc47\u00d7\ud835\udc39. Each element X\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udc53in the tensor corresponds to the value\\nof the\ud835\udc53-th feature at the \ud835\udc61-th time interval in the \ud835\udc5f-th region. To\\nprovide an example, let\u2019s consider predicting taxi traffic patterns in\\nan urban area. In this scenario, the data can represent the inflow\\nand outflow of taxis in a specific region ( e.g., the\ud835\udc5f-th spatial area)\\nduring a given time period from \ud835\udc61to\ud835\udc61\u22121(e.g., a 30-minute interval).\\nSpatio-Temporal Forecasting. In spatio-temporal prediction tasks,\\na common scenario involves forecasting future trends using histor-\\nical data. Specifically, the goal is to predict the data for the next \ud835\udc43\\ntime steps based on information from the preceding \ud835\udc3bsteps.\\nX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+\ud835\udc43=\ud835\udc53(X\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e\u2212\ud835\udc3b+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e) (1)\\nThe function \ud835\udc53(\u00b7)represents a spatio-temporal prediction model\\nthat has been trained effectively using historical data. Spatio-temporal\\nprediction tasks can be divided into two main categories: regression\\nprediction, which involves predicting continuous values like traffic\\nflow or taxi demand [ 22], and classification prediction, where the\\ngoal is to classify events such as crime occurrence prediction [ 11].\\nTo optimize the model \ud835\udc53(\u00b7), different loss functions are utilized\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 3\\n\\nbased on the specific characteristics of the spatio-temporal scenar-\\nios.\\nSpatio-Temporal Zero-Shot Learning . Despite the effectiveness\\nof current spatio-temporal learning approaches, they often en-\\ncounter difficulties in effectively generalizing across a wide range of\\ndownstream spatio-temporal learning scenarios. In this study, our\\nfocus is on addressing the challenge of spatio-temporal zero-shot\\nscenarios, where we aim to learn from previously unseen data in\\ndownstream spatio-temporal prediction datasets or tasks. This can\\nbe formally defined as follows:\\n\u02dcX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+\ud835\udc43=\u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u02dcX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e\u2212\ud835\udc3b+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e) (2)\\nIn this particular scenario, the prediction function \u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u00b7)is responsi-\\nble for forecasting the spatio-temporal data \u02dcXfrom downstream\\ntasks that have not been previously encountered. It should be noted\\nthat the model \u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u00b7)is not trained specifically on the target data.\\n3 METHODOLOGY\\n3.1 Spatio-Temporal Dependency Encoder\\nAlthough large language models demonstrate exceptional profi-\\nciency in language processing, they face challenges in comprehend-\\ning the time-evolving patterns inherent in spatio-temporal data. To\\novercome this limitation, we propose enhancing the capability of\\nlarge language models to capture temporal dependencies within\\nspatio-temporal contexts. This is accomplished by integrating a\\nspatio-temporal encoder that incorporates a multi-level tempo-\\nral convolutional network. By doing so, we enable the model to\\neffectively capture the intricate temporal dependencies across vari-\\nous time resolutions, thereby improving its understanding of the\\ncomplex temporal dynamics present in the spatio-temporal data.\\nSpecifically, our spatio-temporal encoder is composed of two key\\ncomponents: a gated dilated convolution layer and a multi-level\\ncorrelation injection layer. Let\u2019s formalize this architecture as:\\n\u03a8(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f=(\u00afW(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc58\u2217E(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+\u00afb(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc58)\u00b7\ud835\udeff(\u00afW(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc54\u2217E(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+\u00afb(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc54)+E\u2032(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f (3)\\nWe begin with the initial spatio-temporal embedding, denoted as\\nE\ud835\udc5f\u2208R\ud835\udc47\u00d7\ud835\udc51. This embedding is obtained by enhancing the original\\ndata Xthrough a linear layer. To address the issue of gradient\\nvanishing, we utilize a slice of E\ud835\udc5f, denoted as E\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5f\u2208R\ud835\udc47\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51, which\\nis determined by the size of the dilated convolutional kernel. This\\nslice is employed for performing residual operations. To perform\\nthe residual operations, we use 1-D dilated convolution kernels\\n\u00afW\ud835\udc58and \u00afW\ud835\udc54\u2208R\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc54\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61, along with the corresponding bias\\nterms \u00afb\ud835\udc58and \u00afb\ud835\udc54\u2208R\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61. The sigmoid activation function \ud835\udeffis\\napplied to control the degree of information preservation during the\\nrepeated convolution operation. After the gated temporal dilated\\nconvolutional layer encoding, we are able to effectively capture the\\ntemporal dependencies across multiple time steps, resulting in the\\ngeneration of temporal representations.\\nThese representations contain different levels of temporal de-\\npendencies, reflecting various granularity-aware time-evolving pat-\\nterns. To preserve these informative patterns, we introduce a multi-\\nlevel correlation injection layer. This layer is designed to incorpo-\\nrate correlations between different levels and is formalized as:\\nS(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f=(W(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc60\u2217\u03a8(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+b(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc60)+S(\ud835\udc59\u22121)\\n\ud835\udc5f (4)We have the convolution kernel W\ud835\udc60\u2208R\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc46\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\u00d7\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61and the bias\\nvector b\ud835\udc60\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61. These are employed after \ud835\udc3flayers of encoding.\\nA simple non-linear layer is employed to merge the results from\\nequations 3 and 4, and the final spatio-temporal dependency repre-\\nsentations of are denoted as \u02dc\u03a8\u2208R\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc39\u00d7\ud835\udc51. To address the diverse\\nset of urban scenarios that may arise downstream, our proposed\\nspatio-temporal encoder is designed to be independent of graph\\nstructures when modeling spatial correlations. This is particularly\\ncrucial because in zero-shot prediction contexts, the spatial rela-\\ntionships between entities may be unknown or difficult to ascertain.\\nBy not relying on explicit graph structures, our encoder can effec-\\ntively handle a broad spectrum of urban scenarios, where spatial\\ncorrelations and dependencies can vary or be challenging to define\\nin advance. This flexibility enables our model to adapt and perform\\nwell, ensuring its applicability in a wide range of urban contexts.\\n3.2 Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning\\n3.2.1 Spatio-Temporal-Text Alignment. In order to enable lan-\\nguage models to effectively comprehend spatio-temporal patterns,\\nit is crucial to align textual and spatio-temporal information. This\\nalignment allows for the fusion of different modalities, resulting\\nin a more informative representation. By integrating contextual\\nfeatures from both textual and spatio-temporal domains, we can\\ncapture complementary information and extract higher-level se-\\nmantic representations that are more expressive and meaningful.\\nTo achieve this objective, we utilize a lightweight alignment mod-\\nule to project the spatio-temporal dependencies representations\\n\u02dc\u03a8. This projection involves the use of parameters W\ud835\udc5d\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f\\nandb\ud835\udc5d\u2208R\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, where\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3frepresents the commonly used hidden\\ndimension in language models (LLMs).\\nThe resulting projection, denoted as H\u2208R\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc39\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, are rep-\\nresented in the instructions using special tokens as: <ST_start>,\\n<ST_HIS>, ..., <ST_HIS>, <ST_end>. Here, <ST_start> and <ST_end>\\nserve as identifiers marking the beginning and end of the spatio-\\ntemporal token. These identifiers can be included in the large-\\nscale language model by expanding its vocabulary. The placeholder\\n<ST_HIS> represents the spatio-temporal token and corresponds to\\nthe projection Hin the hidden layer. By employing this technique,\\nthe model gains the ability to discern spatio-temporal dependen-\\ncies, thereby enhancing its proficiency in successfully performing\\nspatio-temporal predictive tasks within urban scenes.\\n3.2.2 Spatio-Temporal Prompt Instructions. In scenarios in-\\nvolving spatio-temporal prediction, both temporal and spatial in-\\nformation contain valuable semantic details that contribute to the\\nmodel\u2019s understanding of spatio-temporal patterns within specific\\ncontexts. For instance, traffic flow in the early morning differs sig-\\nnificantly from rush hour, and there are variations in traffic patterns\\nbetween commercial and residential areas. As a result, we recognize\\nthe potential of representing both temporal and spatial information\\nas prompt instruction text. We leverage the text understanding\\ncapabilities of large language models to encode this information,\\nenabling associative reasoning for downstream tasks.\\nIn our UrbanGPT framework, we integrate multi-granularity\\ntime information and spatial details as instruction inputs for the\\nlarge language model. Time information includes factors such as\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 4\\n\\nl = 1l = 2l = 3\\nGateSpatio -Temporal dependenc yencoder\\nLLMs spaceLightweight alignment moduleSpatio -Temporal Instruction -Tuning\\nGiven the historical data and the corresponding tokens\\n<ST_HIS> fortaxi flow \u2026The recording time \u2026This region\\nislocated \u2026Please generate thepredictive tokens for\u2026\\nBased onthe given information, the predictive tokens\\noftaxi inflow and outflow inthis region are<ST_PRE> \u2026\\nLarge Language Models\\nInflow\uff1a[28 26 20 33 49  50 48 34 40 22 \u2026]\\nOutflow\uff1a[40 52 58 32 22 10 18 19 20 24\u2026]City A\\nCity B\\n\u2026\\nInstruction -Tuning Zero -shot prediction\\n<ST_HIS> <ST_HIS> Multi -tasks\\nRegression Layer<ST_HIS> <ST_ PRE> \\ntokens\\nText Replacement\\nLlama VicunaAlignment\\nRegressionST Encoder\\nTask assignment\\nText instructionsInstructions\\nResponsesRegion A\\nRegion B\\nFrozen Trainable\\n\u2026\\nSpatio -Temporal Zero -shot prediction\\nTrain city\\nTest cityTrain region\\nTest region\\nST dependency representations ST Instruction -Tuning of LLMsFigure 2: The overall architecture of the proposed spatio-temporal language model UrbanGPT.\\nTemporal Information :The recording time ofthehistorical data is'January 7,2020 ,08:30,\\nTuesday toJanuary 7,2020 ,14:00,Tuesday, with data points recorded at30-minute intervals' .\\nSpatial Information :Here istheregion information :This region islocated within theStaten\\nIsland borough district and encompasses various POIs within athree -kilometer radius,\\ncovering Public Safety, Education Facility, Residential categories .\\nTask description :Now wewant topredict thetaxi inflow and outflow forthenext 12time\\nsteps during thetime period of'January 7,2020 ,14:30,Tuesday toJanuary 7,2020 ,20:00,\\nTuesday, with data points recorded at30-minute intervals' .\\nFigure 3: Illustration of spatio-temporal prompt instructions\\nencoding the time- and location-aware information.\\nthe day of the week and the hour of the day, while regional in-\\nformation encompasses the city, administrative areas, and nearby\\npoints of interest (POI) data, among others. By incorporating these\\ndiverse elements, UrbanGPT is capable of identifying and assimi-\\nlating spatio-temporal patterns across different regions and time-\\nframes. This enables the model to encapsulate these insights within\\ncomplex spatio-temporal contexts, thereby enhancing its ability\\nfor zero-shot reasoning. The design of the instructional text for\\nspatio-temporal information is illustrated in Figure 3.\\n3.2.3 Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning of LLMs. When\\nit comes to incorporating detailed spatio-temporal textual descrip-\\ntions, the next stage is to fine-tune large language models (LLMs)\\nusing instructions to generate spatio-temporal forecasts in textual\\nformat. However, this approach poses two challenges. Firstly , spatio-\\ntemporal forecasting typically relies on numerical data, which dif-\\nfers in structure and patterns from natural language that language\\nmodels excel at processing, focusing on semantic and syntactic rela-\\ntionships. Secondly , large language models are typically pre-trained\\nusing a multi-classification loss to predict vocabulary, resulting in a\\nprobability distribution of potential outcomes. This contrasts with\\nthe continuous value distribution required for regression tasks.\\nTo address these challenges, UrbanGPT adopts a different strat-\\negy by refraining from directly predicting future spatio-temporal\\nvalues. Instead, it generates forecasting tokens that aid in the pre-\\ndiction process. These tokens are subsequently passed through a\\nregression layer, which maps the hidden representations to generate\\nmore accurate predictive values. The formulation of the regressionlayer in our spatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm is:\\n\u02c6Y\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53=W3[\ud835\udf0e(W1H\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53),\ud835\udf0e(W2\u0393\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53)] (5)\\nThe prediction result, denoted as \u02c6Y\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53\u2208R\ud835\udc43, is obtained using the\\nrectified linear unit activation function, represented by \ud835\udf0e. The hid-\\nden representations of the forecasting tokens, denoted as \u0393\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53\u2208\\nR\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, are introduced as a novel term in the vocabulary of large lan-\\nguage models (LLMs). The regression layer is formulated using\\nweight matrices W1\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f,W2\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, and W3\u2208R\ud835\udc43\u00d72\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n,\\nwhere[\u00b7,\u00b7]represents the concatenation operation. While the prob-\\nability distribution of the forecasting tokens remains relatively\\nstable, their hidden representations contain rich spatio-temporal\\ncontextual attributes that capture dynamic spatio-temporal interde-\\npendencies. This enables our model to provide precise predictions\\nby leveraging this contextual information.\\n3.3 Model Optimization\\nBuilding upon the baseline model [ 1,8], we adopt the absolute error\\nloss as our regression loss function. This choice allows us to effec-\\ntively handle predictions across a wide range of urban scenarios.\\nAdditionally, we introduce a classification loss as a joint loss to\\ncater to diverse task requirements. To ensure optimal performance,\\nour model optimizes different losses based on the specific task in-\\nputs. For instance, we utilize the regression loss for tasks such as\\ntraffic flow prediction, while employing the classification loss for\\ntasks like crime prediction. This approach enables our model to\\neffectively address the unique challenges posed by each task and\\ndeliver accurate predictions in various urban scenarios.\\nL\ud835\udc50=\u22121\\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01\\n\ud835\udc56=1[\ud835\udeff(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)\u00b7log(\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)+(1\u2212\ud835\udeff(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56))\u00b7log(1\u2212\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)]\\nL\ud835\udc5f=1\\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01\\n\ud835\udc56=1|\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\u2212\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56|;L=L\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc60+L\ud835\udc5f+L\ud835\udc50 (6)\\nHere,\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56represents a sample from \u02c6Y, and\ud835\udc41represents the total\\nnumber of samples, which is calculated as the product of \ud835\udc45,\ud835\udc47, and\\n\ud835\udc39.

To\\ncapture probability distributions from the prediction, we employ\\nthe sigmoid function denoted by \ud835\udeff. Each of these loss functions\\nplays a specific role in our model, allowing us to effectively handle\\nclassification, regression, and language modeling tasks as needed.\\n4 EVALUATION\\nIn this section, we aim to assess the capabilities of our proposed\\nmodel across various settings by addressing five key questions:\\n\u2022RQ1 : What is the performance and generalization capability of\\nUrbanGPT in diverse zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction tasks?\\n\u2022RQ2 : How does UrbanGPT perform when compared to existing\\nspatio-temporal models in classical supervised scenarios?\\n\u2022RQ3 : What specific contributions do the proposed key compo-\\nnents bring to enhance the capabilities of our UrbanGPT model?\\n\u2022RQ4 : Can the proposed model robustly handle the forecasting\\nscenarios with varying spatio-temporal patterns?\\n4.1 Experimental Setting\\n4.1.1 Dataset Description. To evaluate the effectiveness of the\\nproposed model in predicting spatio-temporal patterns across var-\\nious urban computing scenarios, we conducted experiments us-\\ning four distinct datasets: NYC-taxi, NYC-bike, NYC-crime, and\\nCHI-taxi. These datasets encompass a wide range of data sources\\nto capture the dynamic nature of urban environments, including\\nrecords of taxi travel, bike trajectories, crime incidents in New York\\nCity, and taxi travel data in Chicago. To facilitate our analysis, we\\npartitioned the cities into grid-like regions based on latitude and\\nlongitude information. Within specific time intervals, we aggre-\\ngated statistical measures for each region. For example, this in-\\nvolved calculating the number of taxi inflows and outflows within\\na 30-minute period in region A, or determining the count of theft\\nincidents within a day in region B. Furthermore, Points of Interest\\n(POIs) data can be obtained through APIs provided by map services,\\nutilizing the latitude and longitude of different regions. For more\\ncomprehensive data descriptions, please refer to the Appendix.\\n4.1.2 Evaluation Protocols. In order to investigate the capabili-\\nties of large language models in analyzing diverse spatio-temporal\\ndata across different regions, we selected a subset of taxi, bike, and\\ncrime data from various areas of New York City as our training set.\\n\u2022Zero-Shot Learning Scenarios . We assessed the model perfor-\\nmance by predicting future spatio-temporal data from regions in\\nNYC or even Chicago that were unseen in the training phase.\\n\u2022Supervised Learning Scenarios . We evaluated the model using\\nfuture data from the same regions as the training set.\\nFor regression tasks, we maintained a consistent training and test-\\ning methodology across all baseline models. When it came to classi-\\nfication tasks involving crime data, we utilized binary cross-entropy\\nas the loss function for training and testing the models. Our ex-\\nperiments were conducted using the robust vicuna-7b [ 50] as the\\nfoundational large language model for UrbanGPT. For a more com-\\nprehensive understanding of our methodology and experimental\\nsetup, please refer to the appendix for detailed information.4.1.3 Evaluation Metrics. For regression tasks, we employed\\nMAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)\\nas evaluation metrics. These metrics quantify the discrepancies\\nbetween the predicted outcomes and the actual labels, with lower\\nvalues indicating superior performance [ 12,49]. In the case of clas-\\nsification tasks, we utilized Recall and Macro-F1 as evaluation met-\\nrics to assess performance. Recall measures the model\u2019s ability to\\ncorrectly identify positive instances, while Macro-F1 is a compre-\\nhensive performance metric that combines precision and recall to\\nprovide an overall measure of classification accuracy [11, 30].\\n4.1.4 Baseline Model. We conducted a thorough comparison\\nwith 10 advanced models to establish baselines for our proposed\\nmethod. (i)In the category of RNNs-based spatio-temporal forecast-\\ning methods, we compared our proposed method with AGCRN [ 1],\\nDMVSTNET [ 39] and ST-LSTM [ 33]. These approaches leverage\\nRNNs for modeling and prediction. (ii)The GNNs-based spatio-\\ntemporal models primarily utilize graph neural networks to cap-\\nture spatial correlations and integrate temporal encoders to capture\\nspatio-temporal relationships. The models we compared against\\nin this category include GWN [ 37], MTGNN [ 36], STSGCN [ 26],\\nTGCN [ 47], and STGCN [ 42].(iii) In the attention-based spatio-\\ntemporal models category, the methods employ attention mecha-\\nnisms to model spatio-temporal correlations. The models we com-\\npared against in this category are ASTGCN [8] and STWA [5].\\n4.2 Zero-Shot Prediction Performance (RQ1)\\nIn this section, we thoroughly evaluate the predictive performance\\nof our proposed model in zero-shot scenarios. The results of our\\nevaluation are presented in Table 1 and visualized in Figure 4. Our\\nobjective is to assess the model\u2019s effectiveness in predicting spatio-\\ntemporal patterns in geographical areas that it has not encountered\\nduring training. This evaluation encompasses both cross-region\\nand cross-city settings, allowing us to gain insights into the model\u2019s\\ngeneralization capabilities across different locations.\\n4.2.1 Prediction on Unseen Regions within a City. Cross-\\nregion scenarios entail using data from certain regions within a\\ncity to forecast future conditions in other regions that have not\\nbeen encountered by the model. Through a thorough analysis of\\nthe model\u2019s performance in these cross-region predictions, we can\\ndraw attention to three significant observations:\\ni) Superior Zero-shot Predictive Performance . The results pre-\\nsented in Table 1 highlight the exceptional performance of our\\nproposed model in both regression and classification tasks on vari-\\nous datasets, surpassing the baseline models in zero-shot prediction.\\nThe success of our model can be attributed to two key factors.\\n\u2022Spatio-Temporal-Text-Alignment . The alignment of spatio-\\ntemporal contextual signals with the text comprehension abil-\\nities of language models plays a pivotal role in the success of\\nour proposed model. This fusion enables the model to effectively\\ncapitalize on both the encoded urban dynamics from the spa-\\ntiotemporal signals and the comprehensive understanding of\\ntextual context provided by the LLMs. By leveraging these two\\nessential aspects, our model achieves the remarkable ability to\\ngeneralize its prediction capabilities in zero-shot scenarios.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 6\\n\\nTable 1: Our model\u2019s performance in zero-shot prediction is evaluated on three diverse datasets: NYC-taxi, NYC-bike, and\\nNYC-crime, providing a comprehensive assessment of its predictive capabilities in unseen situations.\\nModelDataset NYC-taxi NYC-bike NYC-crime\\nType Inflow Outflow Inflow Outflow Burglary Robbery\\nMetrics MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE Macro-F1 Recall Macro-F1 Recall\\nAGCRN 10.86 26.51 13.15 36.45 3.41 7.98 3.42 8.08 0.48 0.00 0.49 0.01\\nASTGCN 9.75 24.12 12.42 33.28 5.58 11.58 5.78 12.29 0.49 0.01 0.55 0.09\\nGWN 10.73 26.50 9.67 26.74 3.32 8.17 3.07 7.52 0.48 0.00 0.52 0.04\\nMTGNN 10.16 25.84 12.59 35.38 3.18 7.62 3.20 7.65 0.64 0.27 0.65 0.30\\nSTWA 11.28 28.97 13.54 38.61 4.59 10.94 4.35 10.67 0.48 0.00 0.51 0.03\\nSTSGCN 18.97 41.38 20.07 45.79 6.85 14.98 6.54 14.77 0.48 0.00 0.48 0.00\\nSTGCN 12.54 30.80 14.32 39.58 4.11 9.21 4.45 9.62 0.48 0.00 0.64 0.30\\nTGCN 10.04 25.10 10.98 30.03 2.88 6.55 2.91 6.42 0.56 0.10 0.58 0.13\\nDMVSTNET 11.00 28.29 10.59 29.20 3.80 9.87 3.65 9.21 0.48 0.01 0.59 0.15\\nST-LSTM 16.97 34.43 18.93 44.10 7.78 15.41 6.92 17.12 0.48 0.00 0.49 0.03\\nUrbanGPT 6.16 16.92 6.83 21.78 2.02 5.16 2.01 5.03 0.67 0.34 0.69 0.42\\n\u2022Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning . This adaptive tuning\\nprocess empowers the LLM to effectively integrate crucial in-\\nformation from the instructions, enhancing its comprehension\\nof the complex relationships and dependencies between spatial\\nand temporal factors. By seamlessly merging the spatio-temporal\\ninstruction-tuning with the spatio-temporal dependency encoder,\\nour proposed model, UrbanGPT, successfully preserves universal\\nand transferable spatio-temporal knowledge. Consequently, the\\nmodel becomes capable of capturing the fundamental patterns\\nand dynamics that govern spatio-temporal phenomena, enabling\\nit to make precise predictions in downstream zero-shot scenarios.\\nii) Enhanced Urban Semantic Understanding . Urban seman-\\ntics offer valuable insights into the diverse dimensions of spatial\\nand temporal characteristics. Our approach involves training our\\nmodel on a wide range of datasets, enriching its understanding\\nof spatio-temporal dynamics across different timeframes and geo-\\ngraphical locations. In contrast, baseline models tend to prioritize\\nencoding temporal and spatial dependencies, neglecting the nu-\\nanced semantics that differentiate regions, timeframes, and data\\ncategories. By incorporating comprehensive semantic awareness\\ninto our UrbanGPT, we significantly enhance its ability to make\\naccurate zero-shot predictions in previously unseen regions.\\niii) Improved Performance in Sparse Data Scenarios . Predict-\\ning spatio-temporal patterns in sparse data environments is chal-\\nlenging as models tend to overfit when data points are scarce. This\\nchallenge is particularly notable when predicting crimes, where data\\nis often sparse but crucial for accurate predictions. Baseline mod-\\nels struggle in cross-regional prediction tasks under these sparse\\nconditions, resulting in low recall scores that indicate potential over-\\nfitting. To overcome this limitation, our model integrates spatio-\\ntemporal learning with large language models (LLMs) using an\\neffective spatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm. By incorpo-\\nrating rich semantic insights, our approach enhances the model\u2019s\\nspatio-temporal representations, enabling it to effectively handle\\nsparse data and achieve improved prediction accuracy.\\n4.2.2 Cross-City Prediction Task. To assess the performance of\\nour model in cross-city prediction tasks, we conducted tests on the\\nCHI-taxi dataset, which was not seen during the training phase. The\\nresults, depicted in Figure 4, yielded the following observations:\u2022Consistency in Multi-step Prediction : Our model consistently\\noutperforms the comparison method at each time step. Notably,\\nit maintains a significant advantage in both short-term and long-\\nterm spatio-temporal prediction, demonstrating the robustness\\nof our proposed model in cross-city prediction scenarios.\\n\u2022Effective Knowledge Transfer Across Cities : The prediction\\nresults obtained from the CHI-taxi dataset validate the supe-\\nrior forecasting capabilities of our model in cross-city scenarios.\\nThis enhancement can be attributed to the integration of spatio-\\ntemporal encoders with the spatio-temporal instruction-tuning\\nparadigm. By incorporating these components, our model ef-\\nfectively captures universal and transferable spatio-temporal\\npatterns, allowing it to make accurate predictions. Additionally,\\nby considering different geographical information and temporal\\nfactors alongside the learned transferred knowledge, our model\\nsuccessfully associates spatio-temporal patterns exhibited by\\nsimilar functional areas and historical periods. This comprehen-\\nsive understanding provides valuable insights for making precise\\nzero-shot predictions in cross-city scenarios.\\n4.3 Classical Supervised Prediction Task (RQ2)\\nThis section examines the predictive capabilities of our UrbanGPT\\nin end-to-end supervised prediction scenarios, as presented in Ta-\\nble 2. We will discuss the results from two perspectives below.\\nEnhanced Long-Term Forecasting Abilities : We examined the\\nmodel\u2019s effectiveness in long-term spatio-temporal forecasting by\\nutilizing test datasets that spanned broader time intervals. For in-\\nstance, we trained the model using data from 2017 and evaluated its\\nperformance on data from 2021. The results of these experiments\\ndemonstrate that our UrbanGPT possesses a significant advantage\\nover the baselines, highlighting its superior ability to generalize\\nacross different temporal landscapes. This capability reduces the\\nneed for frequent retraining or incremental updates, making the\\nmodel more aligned with real-world applications. Additionally, the\\nexperiments have confirmed that incorporating additional textual\\nknowledge does not hinder model performance or introduce noise,\\nthus further validating the feasibility of utilizing large language\\nmodels to enhance spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.\\nSpatial Semantic Understanding : Accurately capturing spatial\\ncorrelations is crucial in the realm of spatio-temporal prediction.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 7\\n\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon23456 MAE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOurs\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon3456789101112131415 RMSE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOurs\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon12345 MAE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOurs\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon456789101112131415 RMSE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOursFigure 4: Time step-based prediction comparison experiment conducted on the CHI-taxi dataset.\\nTable 2: Evaluation of performance in the end-to-end super-\\nvised setting on the NYC-taxi and NYC-bike datasets.\\nModelNYC-taxi NYC-bike\\nInflow Outflow Inflow Outflow\\nMAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE\\nAGCRN 2.83 8.35 2.62 9.21 3.30 7.65 3.38 7.73\\nASTGCN 5.41 18.04 5.00 19.29 3.87 7.93 3.66 7.69\\nGWN 3.91 11.93 2.89 10.85 4.30 9.04 3.88 8.29\\nMTGNN 3.09 10.13 2.61 10.96 3.31 7.47 3.26 7.61\\nSTWA 3.90 12.64 3.15 11.32 4.23 9.07 4.18 9.18\\nSTSGCN 4.57 13.93 4.41 15.87 5.10 12.23 4.72 10.78\\nSTGCN 3.45 9.82 3.17 10.53 3.88 9.23 3.90 9.08\\nTGCN 3.99 11.47 3.31 11.58 4.12 7.92 4.11 7.84\\nDMVSTNET 3.83 11.55 2.76 9.88 3.71 7.95 3.69 7.92\\nST-LSTM 7.78 15.41 6.92 17.12 5.00 11.52 4.96 11.41\\nUrbanGPT 2.50 6.78 1.71 6.68 3.11 7.10 3.01 6.94\\nTraditional methods often employ graph networks or attention\\nmechanisms to analyze these correlations.

This approach enables the model to comprehend the\\nshared characteristics of areas with similar functions at a higher\\nsemantic level. Consequently, it deduces patterns of correlation\\nbetween various functional zones and effectively represents the\\ninterconnections among different regions.\\n4.4 Ablation study (RQ3)\\nThis section investigates the impact of different key components\\non the performance of our model, as illustrated in Figure 5. Our\\nrigorous testing primarily revolves around the zero-shot scenario\\nusing the NYC-taxi dataset. Through our analysis, we have distilled\\nthe benefits offered by the different modules into four key points.\\n\u2022(1) Impact of Spatial and Temporal Context :-STC . By re-\\nmoving time and spatial information from the instruction text,\\nwe observed a noticeable decline in the model\u2019s performance.\\nThis can be attributed to the lack of temporal information, forcing\\nthe model to rely solely on spatio-temporal encoders for encoding\\ntime-related features and performing prediction tasks. Furthermore,\\nthe absence of spatial information hindered the model\u2019s ability to\\ncapture spatial correlations, making it challenging to analyze the\\ndistinct spatio-temporal patterns of different areas.\\n\u2022(2) Impact of Instruction-Tuning with Diverse Datasets :-\\nMulti .

As a result, the model\u2019s per-\\nformance was suboptimal. By integrating diverse spatio-temporal\\ndata from multiple sources, our model can effectively capture the\\nunique characteristics of different geographical locations and their\\nevolving spatio-temporal patterns.\\n\u2022(3) Impact of Spatio-Temporal Encoder :-STE . In this vari-\\nant, we disable the spatio-temporal encoder to investigate its\\neffect on aligning the large language model with encoded urban\\ndependency dynamics into latent embedding space.\\nThe results clearly indicate that the absence of the spatio-temporal\\nencoder significantly hampers the performance of the large lan-\\nguage model in spatio-temporal prediction scenarios. This under-\\nscores the crucial role played by the proposed spatio-temporal\\nencoder in enhancing the model\u2019s predictive capabilities.\\n\u2022(4) Regression Layer Incorporation in Instruction-Tuning:\\nT2P. We explicitly instructed UrbanGPT to generate its predic-\\ntions in a textual format. However, the suboptimal performance\\nindicates the challenges in utilizing LLMs for precise numerical\\nregression tasks, as opposed to employing regression layers.\\nThe primary challenge stems from the model\u2019s dependence on\\nmulti-class loss for optimization during training, leading to a mis-\\nmatch between the model\u2019s probabilistic output and the continuous\\nvalue distribution necessary for spatio-temporal forecasting. To\\nbridge this gap, we incorporated a regression predictor into our\\nmodel, significantly improving its capacity to generate more precise\\nnumerical predictions for regression tasks.\\n4.5 Model Robustness Study (RQ4)\\nIn this section, we focus on evaluating the robustness of our Ur-\\nbanGPT across different spatio-temporal pattern scenarios. We cate-\\ngorize regions based on the magnitude of numerical variations, such\\nas taxi flow, during a specific time period. Lower variance indicates\\nstable temporal patterns, while higher variance suggests diverse\\nspatio-temporal patterns in active commercial zones or densely\\npopulated areas.

Deep spatio-temporal\\nprediction methods have gained prominence in deep learning due\\nto their impressive performance. These models typically consist of\\ntwo components: temporal dependency modeling and spatial corre-\\nlation encoding. Early models like D-LSTM [ 43] and ST-resnet [ 45]\\nused RNNs and convolutional networks to model temporal and\\nspatial dependencies. Graph neural networks (GNNs) proved to\\nbe a natural fit for spatial correlation modeling, as seen in models\\nlike STGCN [ 42] and DCRNN [ 14], which utilized graph structures\\nbased on node distances. Techniques such as learnable region-wise\\ngraph structures [ 36,37] and dynamic spatio-temporal graph net-\\nworks [9, 48] have further enhanced spatial correlation modeling.\\nFurthermore, researchers have explored approaches such as\\nmulti-scale temporal learning [ 34] and multi-granularity tempo-\\nral learning [ 8] to encode temporal dependencies. These strategies\\nenable the capture of features like long-term and short-term correla-\\ntions as well as periodicity. These advancements have significantlycontributed to the progress of spatio-temporal prediction. However,\\nit is worth noting that the majority of these studies are tailored\\nfor supervised contexts, with limited research and development\\nfocused on zero-shot spatio-temporal forecasting. This represents\\nan important area that requires further exploration.\\nSpatio-Temporal Pre-training . Spatio-temporal pre-training tech-\\nniques have recently received significant research attention. These\\ntechniques primarily focus on generative [ 16,24] and contrastive [ 46]\\npre-training models to enhance the predictive performance of down-\\nstream tasks. There has also been extensive exploration of pretrain-\\nfinetune frameworks for few-shot learning scenarios [ 13,19], aim-\\ning to improve knowledge transferability by aligning source and\\ntarget data. However, these approaches require training or fine-\\ntuning on target data and lack zero-shot prediction capabilities. In\\nthis work, we address the challenge of data scarcity in downstream\\nurban scenarios by proposing UrbanGPT. Our model demonstrates\\nthe ability to generalize well across various scenarios, mitigating\\nthe need for extensive training or fine-tuning on target data.\\nLarge Language Models. The emergence of large language mod-\\nels [3,21] has recently attracted significant attention due to their\\nunprecedented machine performance in tasks like text understand-\\ning and reasoning. These models have become a hot topic, demon-\\nstrating the potential to advance from intelligent algorithms to\\nartificial intelligence. Open-source large language models such as\\nLlama [ 28,29], Vicuna [ 50], and ChatGLM [ 44] have been released,\\nleading to researchers exploring their application in various fields\\nto enhance transfer learning capabilities with domain knowledge\\nfrom these models. In the computer vision domain, researchers\\nhave combined multimodal large language models with prompt\\nlearning methods to achieve zero-shot predictions in downstream\\ntasks [ 25,51,52]. Furthermore, the capabilities of LLMs in graph\\nreasoning [ 2,4,27], recommendation [ 10,23,35] and traffic anal-\\nysis [ 6] have been extensively studied. However, the utilization\\nof large language models for zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction\\ntasks in the field of urban intelligence remains largely unexplored.\\n6 CONCLUSION\\nWe present the UrbanGPT, a spatio-temporal large language model,\\nto generalize well in diverse urban scenarios. To seamlessly align\\nthe spatio-temporal contextual signals with LLMs, we introduce a\\nspatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm. This empowers the\\nUrbanGPT with the remarkable ability to learn universal and trans-\\nferable spatio-temporal patterns across various types of urban data.\\nThrough extensive experiments and meticulous ablation studies,\\nwe demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of the UrbanGPT\u2019s\\narchitecture and its key components. However, it is important to\\nacknowledge that while the results are promising, there are still\\nlimitations to be addressed in future studies. As a first step, we are\\nactively engaged in collecting a more diverse range of urban data\\nto enhance and refine the capabilities of our UrbanGPT across a\\nbroader spectrum of urban computing domains. Additionally, un-\\nderstanding the decision-making process of our UrbanGPT is of im-\\nportance. While the model demonstrates exceptional performance,\\nproviding interpretability and explainability is equally essential.\\nFuture research efforts will focus on empowering our model with\\nthe ability to interpret and explain its predictions.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 9\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n[1]Lei Bai, Lina Yao, Can Li, Xianzhi Wang, and Can Wang. 2020.

This includes detailed dataset informa-\\ntion, hyperparameter configuration, experimental setting for the\\ninstruction-tuning phase and test phase, as well as the baselines.\\nFurthermore, we present a case study of our UrbanGPT, showcasing\\nits effectiveness for zero-shot spatio-temporal predictions.\\nA.1 Experimental Details Description\\nA.1.1 Dataset Details. We collected data on taxi flows, bicycle\\nflows, and crime incidents in New York City for training and evalu-\\nation. The NYC-taxi dataset contains 263 regions, with each region\\nmeasuring approximately 3km x 3km. The time sampling inter-\\nval for this dataset is 30 minutes. The NYC-bike and NYC-crime\\ndatasets consist of 2162 regions, each represented by a 1km x 1km\\ngrid. The time sampling interval for NYC-bike is also 30 minutes,\\nwhile for NYC-crime, it is 1 day. All datasets cover the time period\\nfrom Jan 1, 2016, to Dec 31, 2021, in NYC. The CHI-taxi dataset\\nincludes 77 regions, with each region measuring approximately\\n4km x 4km. This dataset includes all taxi data from January 1, 2021,\\nto December 31, 2021, with a time sampling interval of 30 minutes.\\nA.1.2 Hyperparameters Settings. The parameters for the di-\\nlation convolution kernel in the time encoder are set as follows:\\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b,\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61, and\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61are all set to 32, with a dilation factor of 1. For\\nour prediction task, we aim to predict the next 12 steps of data\\nbased on the previous 12 steps. Both the history length ( \ud835\udc3b) and\\nprediction length ( \ud835\udc43) are set to 12. The projection layer parameters\\nare configured with \ud835\udc51set to 64 and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3fset to 4096. Lastly, the hidden\\nlayer parameter \ud835\udc51\u2032for the regression layer is set to 128.\\nA.1.3 Further Experimental Setup Descriptions. During the\\ninstruction-tuning phase, we randomly selected 80 regions from\\nthe three datasets in New York City as training data. It\u2019s important\\nto note that the region indices were kept consistent for the NYC-\\nbike and NYC-crime datasets. The training sets had specific time\\nintervals: for NYC-taxi datasets, it ranged from January 1, 2017,\\nto March 31, 2017; for NYC-bike datasets, it covered April 1, 2017,\\nto June 30, 2017; and for NYC-crime datasets, it spanned from\\nJanuary 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018. For the pretraining of the\\nspatio-temporal dependency encoder and the baseline models, we\\nutilized the same data for training to optimize the parameters. The\\nmaximum epoch count was set at 100. In the testing phase, we\\nconducted the following evaluations:\\n\u2022(i)Zero-Shot Prediction . We also selected an additional 80\\nregions from the New York City datasets as unseen test data. For\\nthe NYC-bike and NYC-taxi datasets, we used the first two weeks\\nof data in 2020 for testing. As for the NYC-crime dataset, we used\\nthe entire year of 2020 for testing. In the case of the Chicago city\\ndataset, we evaluated the model using all the data from Dec 2021.\\n\u2022(ii)Classical Supervised Prediction : For evaluation purposes,\\nwe chose the data with the longest time interval, which involved\\ntesting the model using all the data from the NYC-bike and NYC-\\ntaxi datasets specifically for the month of December 2021.\\nA.1.4 Baseline Details. To facilitate our discussion, we have\\ncategorized all the baselines into three distinct categories: RNN-\\nbased models, attention-based models, and graph neural network(GNN)-based spatio-temporal prediction models. Below, we provide\\ndetailed descriptions of each baseline category:\\nRNN-based Spatio-Temporal Methods:\\n\u2022ST-LSTM [33]: It incorporates the Long Short-Term Memory to\\ncapture temporal dependencies in the spatio-temporal data.\\n\u2022AGCRN [1]: RNNs are employed to capture temporal correlations,\\nallowing for the representation of the evolving patterns over time.\\n\u2022DMVSTNET [39]: In this method, RNNs are utilized to effectively\\nmodel temporal dependencies, capturing the patterns that evolve\\nover time. Furthermore, convolutional networks and fully con-\\nnected layers are employed to capture local spatial correlations\\nand establish meaningful spatial relationships.\\nAttention-based Spatio-Temporal Approaches:\\n\u2022ASTGCN [8]: In this method, attention mechanisms are employed\\nto capture multi-granularity temporal correlation features.\\n\u2022STWA [5]: The model incorporates personalized temporal and\\nspatial parameters into the attention module, allowing for the\\nmodeling of dynamic spatio-temporal correlations.\\nSpatio-Temporal GNNs:\\n\u2022GWN [37]: It incorporates a learnable graph structure and 1-D\\nconvolutions to effectively learn spatio-temporal dependencies.\\n\u2022MTGNN [36]: It utilizes a learnable graph structure to model\\nmultivariate temporal correlations. MTGNN employs 1-D dilation\\nconvolutions to generate temporal representations.\\n\u2022TGCN [47]: This model combines graph neural networks (GNNs)\\nfor spatial correlation modeling and recurrent neural networks\\n(RNNs) for temporal correlation modeling.\\n\u2022STGCN [42]: It uses gated temporal convolutions and GNNs to\\nmodel temporal and spatial dependencies, respectively.\\n\u2022STSGCN [26]: It introduces a spatio-temporal graph construction\\nto learn spatial correlations across adjacent time steps.\\nA.2 Case study\\nIn this section, we assess the effectiveness of different large lan-\\nguage models (LLMs) in zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction sce-\\nnarios, as illustrated in Table 3 and Table 4. The instructions pro-\\nvided to the models are clearly indicated in blue font. The results\\ndemonstrate that various LLMs are capable of generating predic-\\ntions based on these instructions, thereby highlighting the effective-\\nness of the prompt design. For instance, ChatGPT relies on historical\\naverages rather than explicitly incorporating temporal or spatial\\ndata in its predictions. Llama-2-70b analyzes specific time periods\\nand regions, but it encounters challenges in encoding numerical\\ntime-series dependencies, resulting in suboptimal predictive perfor-\\nmance. On the other hand, Claude-2.1 effectively summarizes and\\nanalyzes historical data, leveraging peak-hour patterns and points\\nof interest to achieve more accurate traffic trend predictions.\\nOur proposed UrbanGPT seamlessly integrates spatio-temporal\\ncontextual signals with the reasoning capabilities of large language\\nmodels (LLMs) through a spatio-temporal instruction-tuning para-\\ndigm. This integration leads to remarkable improvements in predict-\\ning numerical values and spatio-temporal trends. These findings\\nunderscore the potential and effectiveness of our framework in\\ncapturing universal spatio-temporal patterns, making zero-shot\\nspatio-temporal prediction practical and achievable.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 11\\n\\nTable 3: We examine the zero-shot predictions of different LLMs for bicycle flow in NYC with the provided instructions.\\nInstructions: Given the historical data for bike flow over 12 time steps in a specific region of New York City, the recorded bike inflows\\nare [12 8 9 15 10 12 14 9 6 12 25 20], and the recorded bike outflows are [5 12 12 15 10 11 6 9 4 6 10 15]. The recording time of the\\nhistorical data is \u2019January 14, 2020, 12:00, Tuesday to January 14, 2020, 17:30, Tuesday, with data points recorded at 30-minute intervals\u2019.\\nHere is the region information: This region is located within the Staten Island borough district and encompasses various POIs within a\\none-kilometer radius, covering Education Facility, Cultural Facility, Commercial, Transportation Facility categories. We now aim to\\npredict the bike inflow and outflow for the next 12 time steps during the time period of \u2019January 14, 2020, 18:00, Tuesday to January 14,\\n2020, 23:30, Tuesday, with data points recorded at 30-minute intervals\u2019. To improve prediction accuracy, a spatio-temporal model is\\nutilized to encode the historical bike data as tokens <ST_Start><ST_HIS><ST_HIS><ST_End>, where the first and the second tokens\\ncorrespond to the representations of bike inflow and outflow. Please conduct an analysis of the traffic patterns in this region, taking into\\naccount the provided time and regional information, and then generate the predictions (the predictive tokens for regression).\\nGround true: Based on the given information, the predictions of bike inflow and outflow in this region are [26 38 28 24 20 13 16 9 5 3\\n5 2] and[12 19 10 10 11 9 6 5 4 4 2 2] .\\nLlama-2-70b Responds: Based on the provided historical data, I have ... Here are my predictions for the bike inflow and outflow for the\\nnext 12 time steps:Bike Inflow: [15 18 20 15 12 10 14 12 10 15 18 20] . Bike Outflow: [10 12 15 10 11 12 10 9 6 10 12 15] .\\nThese predictions are based on the following analysis: Time of Day: The traffic patterns during this time are likely to be influenced by\\nthe evening rush hour, with increased bike inflows and outflows during the peak hours...Regional Information: ... This suggests that\\nthere may be a mix of both commuter and recreational bike traffic in the area...\\nChatGPT Responds: To analyze the traffic patterns in the given region and make predictions for the next 12 time steps, we can calculate\\nthe average bike inflow and outflow based on the historical data... Now, we can generate predictions for the next 12 time steps: Predicted\\nBike Inflow: [11.67 11.67... 11.67] . Predicted Bike Outflow: [9.58 9.58... 9.58] ...\\nClaude-2.1 Responds: Based on the provided historical data, this region in Staten Island seems to experience fluctuating yet relatively\\nlow bike traffic flow during the daytime on Tuesdays. The bike inflows range from 6 to 15 per 30-minute interval, while outflows range\\nfrom 4 to 15.Given the region covers education, cultural, commercial, and transportation facilities within a 1km radius, the bike traffic\\nlikely corresponds to people traveling to and from these points of interest. The fluctuations could reflect class/work schedules and\\ntransportation needs throughout the day.For the evening prediction period of 6PM to 11:30PM, we may expect some further fluctuations\\nbut generally declining bike traffic as the day turns to night. People would be finishing up activities and heading home. I would predict\\nthe following bike inflows and outflows for the next 12 time steps: [10 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 1 1] and[8 6 5 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 1 1] ...\\nUrbanGPT Responds: Based on the given information, the predictions (predicted tokens) of bike inflow and outflow in this region are\\n<ST_PRE> [20 21 22 21 17 12 9 7 6 5 5 5] and <ST_PRE> [11 10 8 7 6 6 5 4 4 3 3 2] .\\nTable 4: Zero-shot predictions of different LLMs for taxi flow in NYC with the provided instructions (without spatial information).\\nInstructions: Given the historical data for taxi flow over 12 time steps in a specific region of New York City, the recorded taxi inflows\\nare [111 86 90 78 49 75 46 32 20 14 9 9], and the recorded taxi outflows are [100 91 58 39 47 47 19 22 21 9 16 10]. The recording time of the\\nhistorical data is \u2019January 5, 2020, 20:30, Sunday to January 6, 2020, 02:00, Monday, with data points recorded at 30-minute intervals\u2019. No\\ndescription is available for this region. Now we want to predict the taxi inflow and outflow for the next 12 time steps during the time\\nperiod of \u2019January 6, 2020, 02:30, Monday to January 6, 2020, 08:00, Monday, with data points recorded at 30-minute intervals\u2019...\\nGround true: Based on the given information, the predictions of taxi inflow and outflow in this region are [9 3 3 4 6 3 30 22 58 74 91\\n110] and[5 10 7 15 11 19 43 46 90 146 213 187] .\\nLlama-2-70b Responds: Based on the provided historical data, I have analyzed the traffic patterns... Taxi Inflow: [105 90 80 70 60 55\\n45 35 25 15 10 5] Taxi Outflow: [95 85 70 60 50 45 35 25 15 10 5 0] . The predictions are based on the following factors...\\nChatGPT Responds: To generate predictions for the next 12 time steps, we can use the average values as a baseline...Predicted taxi\\ninflows: [53.33 53.33... 53.33] . Predicted taxi outflows: [40.83 40.83... 40.83] ...\\nClaude-2.1 Responds: The data covers evening hours on a Sunday and early morning hours on a Monday. We can expect lower taxi\\ndemand during later Sunday evening, with some pickup around end-of-weekend times and early Monday commute times. The region\\nis unspecified, so we cannot infer any location-specific usage patterns. Inflow ranges from 49-111 taxis over the 30 minute intervals.\\nOutflow ranges from 19-100 taxis. This indicates the region likely serves both residential and commercial purposes.\\nPrediction: Inflows: [25 15 10 8 7 9 15 25 35 40 45 50] . Outflows: [40 35 20 12 8 10 20 30 45 50 55 60] ...\\nUrbanGPT Responds: Based on the given information, the predictions (predicted tokens) of taxi inflow and outflow in this region are\\n<ST_PRE> [4 4 2 3 4 13 25 39 56 80 101 117] and <ST_PRE> [6 4 2 2 4 13 24 39 56 80 100 115] .\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': \"I'll analyze this UrbanGPT paper to identify the most relevant 5 references that have GitHub repositories.

This has significant implications in the field\\nof urban computing, where the ability to predict transportation\\npatterns can optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance\\noverall urban mobility [ 18,31]. Moreover, anticipating population\\nmovement can aid in effective urban planning and resource alloca-\\ntion [ 7,20]. Additionally, the ability to forecast crimes can greatly\\ncontribute to enhancing public safety [ 32]. Spatio-temporal predic-\\ntion plays a vital role in shaping smarter and more efficient cities,\\nultimately leading to an improved quality of urban life.\\nIt is important to highlight the various types of neural network\\narchitectures commonly adopted in this domain of spatio-temporal\\nprediction. These architectures are designed to capture and model\\nthe complex relationships between spatial and temporal dimensions\\nin the data. One widely employed architecture is the Convolutional\\nNeural Network (CNN) [ 15,39,45], which is effective in extract-\\ning spatial features by applying convolutional filters across the\\ninput data. Another line of spatio-temporal neural networks is the\\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) family [ 1,34,43]. Those spatio-\\ntemporal RNNs are well-suited for capturing temporal dependencies\\nby maintaining a memory state that can retain information over\\ntime. Recently, there has been a surge in the use of Graph Neural\\nNetworks (GNNs) for spatio-temporal prediction [ 36,40,47]. GNNs\\nexcel in modeling complex spatial relationships in data represented\\nas graphs, where each node corresponds to a spatial location and\\nedges capture the connections between them.\\nWhile current spatio-temporal neural network techniques have\\nproven to be highly effective, it is crucial to acknowledge their\\nstrong dependence on having an abundance of labeled data in order\\nto generate accurate predictions. However, the pervasive problem\\nof data scarcity in practical urban sensing scenarios poses a sig-\\nnificant challenge. For example, deploying sensors throughout the\\nentire urban space to monitor citywide traffic volume or air qual-\\nity is impractical due to the high cost involved [ 17,41]. Moreover,\\nthe challenge of limited labeled data availability extends to spatio-\\ntemporal forecasting across different cities, in which acquiring\\nlabeled data for each target city becomes a daunting task [ 13,38].\\nThese issues emphasize the pressing need for novel solutions that\\naddress data scarcity and enhance the generalization capabilities of\\nspatio-temporal models in various smart city applications.\\nInspired by the remarkable progress of large language models\\n(LLMs), our primary goal is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that\\npossesses outstanding generalization capabilities across a wide\\narray of urban tasks. Leveraging the reasoning abilities inherent in\\nLLMs, we aim to expand their success into the domain of spatio-\\ntemporal analysis. Our objective is to develop a model that can\\neffectively comprehend and forecast intricate spatial and temporal\\npatterns, enabling it to excel in various urban scenarios.\\nWhile it is of utmost importance to develop a versatile spatio-\\ntemporal model capable of effectively handling diverse downstreamarXiv:2403.00813v3  [cs.CL]  19 May 2024\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 2\\n\\nInstruction s:Given thehistorical data fortaxiflow over 12time steps inaspecific region ofNew York City, the\\nrecorded taxiinflows are[9194100 939376676650695542],and therecorded taxioutflows are[9691108\\n10283787674106938657]\u2026Please predict thetaxiinflow and outflow fornext 12time steps\u2026\\nLabel s:Taxi Inflow :[5536333033273714167512]Taxi Outflow :[547069593231292120111312].\\nOurs :Based onthegiven information, thepredictions oftaxiinflow and outflow inthisregion are\u2026\\nPrediction :Inflow :[514845424038332824211816]Outflow :[544945413835302521181614].\\nHuman\\nInstructions\\nLLAMA -70BGround true\\nPrediction :Inflow :[282827262524232323232424]Outflow :[343128252219171616151515] Baseline\\nLLM :There isanoticeable spike intaxiinflows and outflows around 10:00-11:00,which may indicate asurge in\\ndemand fortaxiservices\u2026Ihave created apredictive model toforecast thetaxiflow forthenext 12time steps :\\nPrediction :Inflow :[53586460677378849196102 108]Outflow :[5661687379848995102 107 113 119]\\nUrbanGPT\\n2 4 6 8 10 12\\nTime Steps020406080100 Inflow Predicted valueBaseline\\nLLM\\nOurs\\nGround_true\\n2 4 6 8 10 12\\nTime Steps020406080100120 Outflow Predicted valueBaseline\\nLLM\\nOurs\\nGround_trueFigure 1: The superior predictive performance of the pro-\\nposed UrbanGPT compared to the large language model\\n(LLaMA-70B) and the spatiotemporal graph neural network\\n(STGCN) in a zero-shot traffic flow prediction scenario.\\ntasks, aligning the spatio-temporal context with the knowledge\\nspace of large language models (LLMs) and enabling them to com-\\nprehend the complex dependencies across time and space present\\nsignificant challenges. These hurdles call for meticulous model\\ndesign to bridge the gap between the unique characteristics of\\nspatio-temporal data and the knowledge encoded within LLMs.\\nContributions . In light of these challenges, we propose UrbanGPT,\\na large language model specifically tailored for spatio-temporal\\nprediction. At the core of UrbanGPT lies a novel spatio-temporal\\ninstruction-tuning paradigm that seeks to align the intricate de-\\npendencies of time and space, with the knowledge space of LLMs.\\nWithin our UrbanGPT framework, we start by incorporating a\\nspatio-temporal dependency encoder, which utilizes a multi-level\\ntemporal convolutional network. This encoder enables the model\\nto capture the intricate temporal dynamics present in the spatio-\\ntemporal data across various time resolutions. Then, our model\\ninvolves aligning textual and spatio-temporal information to em-\\npower language models in effectively injecting spatio-temporal\\ncontextual signals. This is achieved through the utilization of a\\nlightweight alignment module that projects the representations\\nof spatio-temporal dependencies. The result is the generation of\\nmore expressive semantic representations by integrating valuable\\ninformation from both textual and spatio-temporal domains.\\nThrough the incorporation of spatio-temporal information dur-\\ning the instruction-tuning process, the language model gains profi-\\nciency in understanding and processing the intricate relationships\\nand patterns found in spatio-temporal data. By leveraging the in-\\nsights obtained from the spatio-temporal domain, the language\\nmodel becomes better equipped to capture the nuances and com-\\nplexities of spatio-temporal phenomena. This, in turn, enables the\\nmodel to make more reliable and insightful predictions across vari-\\nous urban scenarios, even when faced with limited data availability.\\nTo showcase the superior predictive performance of our pro-\\nposed model, we compare it with the large language model (LLaMA-\\n70B) and the spatio-temporal graph neural network (STGCN) in azero-shot traffic flow prediction scenario guided by textual instruc-\\ntions, as depicted in Figure 1. The large language model, LLaMA,\\neffectively infers traffic patterns from the input text. However, its\\nlimitations in handling numeric time-series data with complex spa-\\ntial and temporal dependencies can sometimes lead to opposite\\ntraffic trend predictions. On the other hand, the pre-trained base-\\nline model demonstrates a strong understanding of spatio-temporal\\ndependencies. However, it may suffer from overfitting to the source\\ndataset and underperform in zero-shot scenarios, indicating its lim-\\nited generalization capabilities beyond existing spatio-temporal\\nprediction models. In contrast, our proposed model achieves a har-\\nmonious integration of domain-specific spatio-temporal knowledge\\nand language modeling capabilities. This enables us to make more\\naccurate and reliable predictions under data scarcity.\\nIn summary, our main contributions can be outlined as follows:\\n\u2022To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop\\na spatio-temporal large language model capable of predicting\\ndiverse urban phenomena across different datasets, especially\\nunder conditions of limited data availability.\\n\u2022We propose UrbanGPT, a spatio-temporal prediction framework\\nthat empowers large language models (LLMs) to comprehend\\nthe intricate inter-dependencies across time and space. This is\\nachieved through the seamless integration of a spatio-temporal\\ndependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm, ef-\\nfectively aligning the spatio-temporal context with LLMs.\\n\u2022Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets\\nprovide compelling evidence of our proposed UrbanGPT\u2019s excep-\\ntional ability to generalize in zero-shot spatio-temporal learning\\nscenarios. These findings highlight the model\u2019s robust general-\\nization capacity, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately\\npredicting and understanding spatio-temporal patterns, even in\\nscenarios where no prior training data is available.\\n2 PRELIMINARIES\\nSpatio-Temporal Data . Spatio-temporal data is commonly col-\\nlected and can be represented as a three-dimensional tensor X\u2208\\nR\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc47\u00d7\ud835\udc39. Each element X\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udc53in the tensor corresponds to the value\\nof the\ud835\udc53-th feature at the \ud835\udc61-th time interval in the \ud835\udc5f-th region. To\\nprovide an example, let\u2019s consider predicting taxi traffic patterns in\\nan urban area. In this scenario, the data can represent the inflow\\nand outflow of taxis in a specific region ( e.g., the\ud835\udc5f-th spatial area)\\nduring a given time period from \ud835\udc61to\ud835\udc61\u22121(e.g., a 30-minute interval).\\nSpatio-Temporal Forecasting.

Despite the effectiveness\\nof current spatio-temporal learning approaches, they often en-\\ncounter difficulties in effectively generalizing across a wide range of\\ndownstream spatio-temporal learning scenarios. In this study, our\\nfocus is on addressing the challenge of spatio-temporal zero-shot\\nscenarios, where we aim to learn from previously unseen data in\\ndownstream spatio-temporal prediction datasets or tasks. This can\\nbe formally defined as follows:\\n\u02dcX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+\ud835\udc43=\u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u02dcX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e\u2212\ud835\udc3b+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e) (2)\\nIn this particular scenario, the prediction function \u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u00b7)is responsi-\\nble for forecasting the spatio-temporal data \u02dcXfrom downstream\\ntasks that have not been previously encountered. It should be noted\\nthat the model \u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u00b7)is not trained specifically on the target data.\\n3 METHODOLOGY\\n3.1 Spatio-Temporal Dependency Encoder\\nAlthough large language models demonstrate exceptional profi-\\nciency in language processing, they face challenges in comprehend-\\ning the time-evolving patterns inherent in spatio-temporal data. To\\novercome this limitation, we propose enhancing the capability of\\nlarge language models to capture temporal dependencies within\\nspatio-temporal contexts. This is accomplished by integrating a\\nspatio-temporal encoder that incorporates a multi-level tempo-\\nral convolutional network. By doing so, we enable the model to\\neffectively capture the intricate temporal dependencies across vari-\\nous time resolutions, thereby improving its understanding of the\\ncomplex temporal dynamics present in the spatio-temporal data.\\nSpecifically, our spatio-temporal encoder is composed of two key\\ncomponents: a gated dilated convolution layer and a multi-level\\ncorrelation injection layer. Let\u2019s formalize this architecture as:\\n\u03a8(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f=(\u00afW(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc58\u2217E(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+\u00afb(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc58)\u00b7\ud835\udeff(\u00afW(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc54\u2217E(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+\u00afb(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc54)+E\u2032(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f (3)\\nWe begin with the initial spatio-temporal embedding, denoted as\\nE\ud835\udc5f\u2208R\ud835\udc47\u00d7\ud835\udc51. This embedding is obtained by enhancing the original\\ndata Xthrough a linear layer. To address the issue of gradient\\nvanishing, we utilize a slice of E\ud835\udc5f, denoted as E\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5f\u2208R\ud835\udc47\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51, which\\nis determined by the size of the dilated convolutional kernel. This\\nslice is employed for performing residual operations. To perform\\nthe residual operations, we use 1-D dilated convolution kernels\\n\u00afW\ud835\udc58and \u00afW\ud835\udc54\u2208R\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc54\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61, along with the corresponding bias\\nterms \u00afb\ud835\udc58and \u00afb\ud835\udc54\u2208R\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61. The sigmoid activation function \ud835\udeffis\\napplied to control the degree of information preservation during the\\nrepeated convolution operation. After the gated temporal dilated\\nconvolutional layer encoding, we are able to effectively capture the\\ntemporal dependencies across multiple time steps, resulting in the\\ngeneration of temporal representations.\\nThese representations contain different levels of temporal de-\\npendencies, reflecting various granularity-aware time-evolving pat-\\nterns. To preserve these informative patterns, we introduce a multi-\\nlevel correlation injection layer. This layer is designed to incorpo-\\nrate correlations between different levels and is formalized as:\\nS(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f=(W(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc60\u2217\u03a8(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+b(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc60)+S(\ud835\udc59\u22121)\\n\ud835\udc5f (4)We have the convolution kernel W\ud835\udc60\u2208R\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc46\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\u00d7\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61and the bias\\nvector b\ud835\udc60\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61. These are employed after \ud835\udc3flayers of encoding.\\nA simple non-linear layer is employed to merge the results from\\nequations 3 and 4, and the final spatio-temporal dependency repre-\\nsentations of are denoted as \u02dc\u03a8\u2208R\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc39\u00d7\ud835\udc51. To address the diverse\\nset of urban scenarios that may arise downstream, our proposed\\nspatio-temporal encoder is designed to be independent of graph\\nstructures when modeling spatial correlations. This is particularly\\ncrucial because in zero-shot prediction contexts, the spatial rela-\\ntionships between entities may be unknown or difficult to ascertain.\\nBy not relying on explicit graph structures, our encoder can effec-\\ntively handle a broad spectrum of urban scenarios, where spatial\\ncorrelations and dependencies can vary or be challenging to define\\nin advance. This flexibility enables our model to adapt and perform\\nwell, ensuring its applicability in a wide range of urban contexts.\\n3.2 Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning\\n3.2.1 Spatio-Temporal-Text Alignment. In order to enable lan-\\nguage models to effectively comprehend spatio-temporal patterns,\\nit is crucial to align textual and spatio-temporal information. This\\nalignment allows for the fusion of different modalities, resulting\\nin a more informative representation. By integrating contextual\\nfeatures from both textual and spatio-temporal domains, we can\\ncapture complementary information and extract higher-level se-\\nmantic representations that are more expressive and meaningful.\\nTo achieve this objective, we utilize a lightweight alignment mod-\\nule to project the spatio-temporal dependencies representations\\n\u02dc\u03a8. This projection involves the use of parameters W\ud835\udc5d\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f\\nandb\ud835\udc5d\u2208R\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, where\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3frepresents the commonly used hidden\\ndimension in language models (LLMs).\\nThe resulting projection, denoted as H\u2208R\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc39\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, are rep-\\nresented in the instructions using special tokens as: <ST_start>,\\n<ST_HIS>, ..., <ST_HIS>, <ST_end>. Here, <ST_start> and <ST_end>\\nserve as identifiers marking the beginning and end of the spatio-\\ntemporal token. These identifiers can be included in the large-\\nscale language model by expanding its vocabulary. The placeholder\\n<ST_HIS> represents the spatio-temporal token and corresponds to\\nthe projection Hin the hidden layer. By employing this technique,\\nthe model gains the ability to discern spatio-temporal dependen-\\ncies, thereby enhancing its proficiency in successfully performing\\nspatio-temporal predictive tasks within urban scenes.\\n3.2.2 Spatio-Temporal Prompt Instructions. In scenarios in-\\nvolving spatio-temporal prediction, both temporal and spatial in-\\nformation contain valuable semantic details that contribute to the\\nmodel\u2019s understanding of spatio-temporal patterns within specific\\ncontexts. For instance, traffic flow in the early morning differs sig-\\nnificantly from rush hour, and there are variations in traffic patterns\\nbetween commercial and residential areas. As a result, we recognize\\nthe potential of representing both temporal and spatial information\\nas prompt instruction text. We leverage the text understanding\\ncapabilities of large language models to encode this information,\\nenabling associative reasoning for downstream tasks.\\nIn our UrbanGPT framework, we integrate multi-granularity\\ntime information and spatial details as instruction inputs for the\\nlarge language model. Time information includes factors such as\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 4\\n\\nl = 1l = 2l = 3\\nGateSpatio -Temporal dependenc yencoder\\nLLMs spaceLightweight alignment moduleSpatio -Temporal Instruction -Tuning\\nGiven the historical data and the corresponding tokens\\n<ST_HIS> fortaxi flow \u2026The recording time \u2026This region\\nislocated \u2026Please generate thepredictive tokens for\u2026\\nBased onthe given information, the predictive tokens\\noftaxi inflow and outflow inthis region are<ST_PRE> \u2026\\nLarge Language Models\\nInflow\uff1a[28 26 20 33 49  50 48 34 40 22 \u2026]\\nOutflow\uff1a[40 52 58 32 22 10 18 19 20 24\u2026]City A\\nCity B\\n\u2026\\nInstruction -Tuning Zero -shot prediction\\n<ST_HIS> <ST_HIS> Multi -tasks\\nRegression Layer<ST_HIS> <ST_ PRE> \\ntokens\\nText Replacement\\nLlama VicunaAlignment\\nRegressionST Encoder\\nTask assignment\\nText instructionsInstructions\\nResponsesRegion A\\nRegion B\\nFrozen Trainable\\n\u2026\\nSpatio -Temporal Zero -shot prediction\\nTrain city\\nTest cityTrain region\\nTest region\\nST dependency representations ST Instruction -Tuning of LLMsFigure 2: The overall architecture of the proposed spatio-temporal language model UrbanGPT.\\nTemporal Information :The recording time ofthehistorical data is'January 7,2020 ,08:30,\\nTuesday toJanuary 7,2020 ,14:00,Tuesday, with data points recorded at30-minute intervals' .\\nSpatial Information :Here istheregion information :This region islocated within theStaten\\nIsland borough district and encompasses various POIs within athree -kilometer radius,\\ncovering Public Safety, Education Facility, Residential categories .\\nTask description :Now wewant topredict thetaxi inflow and outflow forthenext 12time\\nsteps during thetime period of'January 7,2020 ,14:30,Tuesday toJanuary 7,2020 ,20:00,\\nTuesday, with data points recorded at30-minute intervals' .\\nFigure 3: Illustration of spatio-temporal prompt instructions\\nencoding the time- and location-aware information.\\nthe day of the week and the hour of the day, while regional in-\\nformation encompasses the city, administrative areas, and nearby\\npoints of interest (POI) data, among others. By incorporating these\\ndiverse elements, UrbanGPT is capable of identifying and assimi-\\nlating spatio-temporal patterns across different regions and time-\\nframes. This enables the model to encapsulate these insights within\\ncomplex spatio-temporal contexts, thereby enhancing its ability\\nfor zero-shot reasoning. The design of the instructional text for\\nspatio-temporal information is illustrated in Figure 3.\\n3.2.3 Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning of LLMs. When\\nit comes to incorporating detailed spatio-temporal textual descrip-\\ntions, the next stage is to fine-tune large language models (LLMs)\\nusing instructions to generate spatio-temporal forecasts in textual\\nformat. However, this approach poses two challenges. Firstly , spatio-\\ntemporal forecasting typically relies on numerical data, which dif-\\nfers in structure and patterns from natural language that language\\nmodels excel at processing, focusing on semantic and syntactic rela-\\ntionships. Secondly , large language models are typically pre-trained\\nusing a multi-classification loss to predict vocabulary, resulting in a\\nprobability distribution of potential outcomes. This contrasts with\\nthe continuous value distribution required for regression tasks.\\nTo address these challenges, UrbanGPT adopts a different strat-\\negy by refraining from directly predicting future spatio-temporal\\nvalues. Instead, it generates forecasting tokens that aid in the pre-\\ndiction process. These tokens are subsequently passed through a\\nregression layer, which maps the hidden representations to generate\\nmore accurate predictive values. The formulation of the regressionlayer in our spatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm is:\\n\u02c6Y\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53=W3[\ud835\udf0e(W1H\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53),\ud835\udf0e(W2\u0393\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53)] (5)\\nThe prediction result, denoted as \u02c6Y\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53\u2208R\ud835\udc43, is obtained using the\\nrectified linear unit activation function, represented by \ud835\udf0e. The hid-\\nden representations of the forecasting tokens, denoted as \u0393\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53\u2208\\nR\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, are introduced as a novel term in the vocabulary of large lan-\\nguage models (LLMs). The regression layer is formulated using\\nweight matrices W1\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f,W2\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, and W3\u2208R\ud835\udc43\u00d72\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n,\\nwhere[\u00b7,\u00b7]represents the concatenation operation. While the prob-\\nability distribution of the forecasting tokens remains relatively\\nstable, their hidden representations contain rich spatio-temporal\\ncontextual attributes that capture dynamic spatio-temporal interde-\\npendencies. This enables our model to provide precise predictions\\nby leveraging this contextual information.\\n3.3 Model Optimization\\nBuilding upon the baseline model [ 1,8], we adopt the absolute error\\nloss as our regression loss function. This choice allows us to effec-\\ntively handle predictions across a wide range of urban scenarios.\\nAdditionally, we introduce a classification loss as a joint loss to\\ncater to diverse task requirements. To ensure optimal performance,\\nour model optimizes different losses based on the specific task in-\\nputs. For instance, we utilize the regression loss for tasks such as\\ntraffic flow prediction, while employing the classification loss for\\ntasks like crime prediction. This approach enables our model to\\neffectively address the unique challenges posed by each task and\\ndeliver accurate predictions in various urban scenarios.\\nL\ud835\udc50=\u22121\\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01\\n\ud835\udc56=1[\ud835\udeff(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)\u00b7log(\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)+(1\u2212\ud835\udeff(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56))\u00b7log(1\u2212\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)]\\nL\ud835\udc5f=1\\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01\\n\ud835\udc56=1|\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\u2212\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56|;L=L\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc60+L\ud835\udc5f+L\ud835\udc50 (6)\\nHere,\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56represents a sample from \u02c6Y, and\ud835\udc41represents the total\\nnumber of samples, which is calculated as the product of \ud835\udc45,\ud835\udc47, and\\n\ud835\udc39. We use various loss functions in our model, including L\ud835\udc50for\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 5\\n\\nbinary cross-entropy loss, L\ud835\udc5ffor regression loss, and the cross-\\nentropy loss adopted in our spatio-temporal language models. To\\ncapture probability distributions from the prediction, we employ\\nthe sigmoid function denoted by \ud835\udeff. Each of these loss functions\\nplays a specific role in our model, allowing us to effectively handle\\nclassification, regression, and language modeling tasks as needed.\\n4 EVALUATION\\nIn this section, we aim to assess the capabilities of our proposed\\nmodel across various settings by addressing five key questions:\\n\u2022RQ1 : What is the performance and generalization capability of\\nUrbanGPT in diverse zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction tasks?\\n\u2022RQ2 : How does UrbanGPT perform when compared to existing\\nspatio-temporal models in classical supervised scenarios?\\n\u2022RQ3 : What specific contributions do the proposed key compo-\\nnents bring to enhance the capabilities of our UrbanGPT model?\\n\u2022RQ4 : Can the proposed model robustly handle the forecasting\\nscenarios with varying spatio-temporal patterns?\\n4.1 Experimental Setting\\n4.1.1 Dataset Description. To evaluate the effectiveness of the\\nproposed model in predicting spatio-temporal patterns across var-\\nious urban computing scenarios, we conducted experiments us-\\ning four distinct datasets: NYC-taxi, NYC-bike, NYC-crime, and\\nCHI-taxi. These datasets encompass a wide range of data sources\\nto capture the dynamic nature of urban environments, including\\nrecords of taxi travel, bike trajectories, crime incidents in New York\\nCity, and taxi travel data in Chicago. To facilitate our analysis, we\\npartitioned the cities into grid-like regions based on latitude and\\nlongitude information. Within specific time intervals, we aggre-\\ngated statistical measures for each region. For example, this in-\\nvolved calculating the number of taxi inflows and outflows within\\na 30-minute period in region A, or determining the count of theft\\nincidents within a day in region B. Furthermore, Points of Interest\\n(POIs) data can be obtained through APIs provided by map services,\\nutilizing the latitude and longitude of different regions. For more\\ncomprehensive data descriptions, please refer to the Appendix.\\n4.1.2 Evaluation Protocols. In order to investigate the capabili-\\nties of large language models in analyzing diverse spatio-temporal\\ndata across different regions, we selected a subset of taxi, bike, and\\ncrime data from various areas of New York City as our training set.\\n\u2022Zero-Shot Learning Scenarios . We assessed the model perfor-\\nmance by predicting future spatio-temporal data from regions in\\nNYC or even Chicago that were unseen in the training phase.\\n\u2022Supervised Learning Scenarios . We evaluated the model using\\nfuture data from the same regions as the training set.\\nFor regression tasks, we maintained a consistent training and test-\\ning methodology across all baseline models. When it came to classi-\\nfication tasks involving crime data, we utilized binary cross-entropy\\nas the loss function for training and testing the models. Our ex-\\nperiments were conducted using the robust vicuna-7b [ 50] as the\\nfoundational large language model for UrbanGPT. For a more com-\\nprehensive understanding of our methodology and experimental\\nsetup, please refer to the appendix for detailed information.4.1.3 Evaluation Metrics. For regression tasks, we employed\\nMAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)\\nas evaluation metrics. These metrics quantify the discrepancies\\nbetween the predicted outcomes and the actual labels, with lower\\nvalues indicating superior performance [ 12,49]. In the case of clas-\\nsification tasks, we utilized Recall and Macro-F1 as evaluation met-\\nrics to assess performance. Recall measures the model\u2019s ability to\\ncorrectly identify positive instances, while Macro-F1 is a compre-\\nhensive performance metric that combines precision and recall to\\nprovide an overall measure of classification accuracy [11, 30].\\n4.1.4 Baseline Model. We conducted a thorough comparison\\nwith 10 advanced models to establish baselines for our proposed\\nmethod. (i)In the category of RNNs-based spatio-temporal forecast-\\ning methods, we compared our proposed method with AGCRN [ 1],\\nDMVSTNET [ 39] and ST-LSTM [ 33]. These approaches leverage\\nRNNs for modeling and prediction. (ii)The GNNs-based spatio-\\ntemporal models primarily utilize graph neural networks to cap-\\nture spatial correlations and integrate temporal encoders to capture\\nspatio-temporal relationships. The models we compared against\\nin this category include GWN [ 37], MTGNN [ 36], STSGCN [ 26],\\nTGCN [ 47], and STGCN [ 42].(iii) In the attention-based spatio-\\ntemporal models category, the methods employ attention mecha-\\nnisms to model spatio-temporal correlations. The models we com-\\npared against in this category are ASTGCN [8] and STWA [5].\\n4.2 Zero-Shot Prediction Performance (RQ1)\\nIn this section, we thoroughly evaluate the predictive performance\\nof our proposed model in zero-shot scenarios. The results of our\\nevaluation are presented in Table 1 and visualized in Figure 4. Our\\nobjective is to assess the model\u2019s effectiveness in predicting spatio-\\ntemporal patterns in geographical areas that it has not encountered\\nduring training. This evaluation encompasses both cross-region\\nand cross-city settings, allowing us to gain insights into the model\u2019s\\ngeneralization capabilities across different locations.\\n4.2.1 Prediction on Unseen Regions within a City. Cross-\\nregion scenarios entail using data from certain regions within a\\ncity to forecast future conditions in other regions that have not\\nbeen encountered by the model. Through a thorough analysis of\\nthe model\u2019s performance in these cross-region predictions, we can\\ndraw attention to three significant observations:\\ni) Superior Zero-shot Predictive Performance . The results pre-\\nsented in Table 1 highlight the exceptional performance of our\\nproposed model in both regression and classification tasks on vari-\\nous datasets, surpassing the baseline models in zero-shot prediction.\\nThe success of our model can be attributed to two key factors.\\n\u2022Spatio-Temporal-Text-Alignment . The alignment of spatio-\\ntemporal contextual signals with the text comprehension abil-\\nities of language models plays a pivotal role in the success of\\nour proposed model. This fusion enables the model to effectively\\ncapitalize on both the encoded urban dynamics from the spa-\\ntiotemporal signals and the comprehensive understanding of\\ntextual context provided by the LLMs. By leveraging these two\\nessential aspects, our model achieves the remarkable ability to\\ngeneralize its prediction capabilities in zero-shot scenarios.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 6\\n\\nTable 1: Our model\u2019s performance in zero-shot prediction is evaluated on three diverse datasets: NYC-taxi, NYC-bike, and\\nNYC-crime, providing a comprehensive assessment of its predictive capabilities in unseen situations.\\nModelDataset NYC-taxi NYC-bike NYC-crime\\nType Inflow Outflow Inflow Outflow Burglary Robbery\\nMetrics MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE Macro-F1 Recall Macro-F1 Recall\\nAGCRN 10.86 26.51 13.15 36.45 3.41 7.98 3.42 8.08 0.48 0.00 0.49 0.01\\nASTGCN 9.75 24.12 12.42 33.28 5.58 11.58 5.78 12.29 0.49 0.01 0.55 0.09\\nGWN 10.73 26.50 9.67 26.74 3.32 8.17 3.07 7.52 0.48 0.00 0.52 0.04\\nMTGNN 10.16 25.84 12.59 35.38 3.18 7.62 3.20 7.65 0.64 0.27 0.65 0.30\\nSTWA 11.28 28.97 13.54 38.61 4.59 10.94 4.35 10.67 0.48 0.00 0.51 0.03\\nSTSGCN 18.97 41.38 20.07 45.79 6.85 14.98 6.54 14.77 0.48 0.00 0.48 0.00\\nSTGCN 12.54 30.80 14.32 39.58 4.11 9.21 4.45 9.62 0.48 0.00 0.64 0.30\\nTGCN 10.04 25.10 10.98 30.03 2.88 6.55 2.91 6.42 0.56 0.10 0.58 0.13\\nDMVSTNET 11.00 28.29 10.59 29.20 3.80 9.87 3.65 9.21 0.48 0.01 0.59 0.15\\nST-LSTM 16.97 34.43 18.93 44.10 7.78 15.41 6.92 17.12 0.48 0.00 0.49 0.03\\nUrbanGPT 6.16 16.92 6.83 21.78 2.02 5.16 2.01 5.03 0.67 0.34 0.69 0.42\\n\u2022Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning .

Predict-\\ning spatio-temporal patterns in sparse data environments is chal-\\nlenging as models tend to overfit when data points are scarce. This\\nchallenge is particularly notable when predicting crimes, where data\\nis often sparse but crucial for accurate predictions. Baseline mod-\\nels struggle in cross-regional prediction tasks under these sparse\\nconditions, resulting in low recall scores that indicate potential over-\\nfitting. To overcome this limitation, our model integrates spatio-\\ntemporal learning with large language models (LLMs) using an\\neffective spatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm. By incorpo-\\nrating rich semantic insights, our approach enhances the model\u2019s\\nspatio-temporal representations, enabling it to effectively handle\\nsparse data and achieve improved prediction accuracy.\\n4.2.2 Cross-City Prediction Task. To assess the performance of\\nour model in cross-city prediction tasks, we conducted tests on the\\nCHI-taxi dataset, which was not seen during the training phase. The\\nresults, depicted in Figure 4, yielded the following observations:\u2022Consistency in Multi-step Prediction : Our model consistently\\noutperforms the comparison method at each time step. Notably,\\nit maintains a significant advantage in both short-term and long-\\nterm spatio-temporal prediction, demonstrating the robustness\\nof our proposed model in cross-city prediction scenarios.\\n\u2022Effective Knowledge Transfer Across Cities : The prediction\\nresults obtained from the CHI-taxi dataset validate the supe-\\nrior forecasting capabilities of our model in cross-city scenarios.\\nThis enhancement can be attributed to the integration of spatio-\\ntemporal encoders with the spatio-temporal instruction-tuning\\nparadigm. By incorporating these components, our model ef-\\nfectively captures universal and transferable spatio-temporal\\npatterns, allowing it to make accurate predictions. Additionally,\\nby considering different geographical information and temporal\\nfactors alongside the learned transferred knowledge, our model\\nsuccessfully associates spatio-temporal patterns exhibited by\\nsimilar functional areas and historical periods. This comprehen-\\nsive understanding provides valuable insights for making precise\\nzero-shot predictions in cross-city scenarios.\\n4.3 Classical Supervised Prediction Task (RQ2)\\nThis section examines the predictive capabilities of our UrbanGPT\\nin end-to-end supervised prediction scenarios, as presented in Ta-\\nble 2. We will discuss the results from two perspectives below.\\nEnhanced Long-Term Forecasting Abilities : We examined the\\nmodel\u2019s effectiveness in long-term spatio-temporal forecasting by\\nutilizing test datasets that spanned broader time intervals. For in-\\nstance, we trained the model using data from 2017 and evaluated its\\nperformance on data from 2021. The results of these experiments\\ndemonstrate that our UrbanGPT possesses a significant advantage\\nover the baselines, highlighting its superior ability to generalize\\nacross different temporal landscapes. This capability reduces the\\nneed for frequent retraining or incremental updates, making the\\nmodel more aligned with real-world applications. Additionally, the\\nexperiments have confirmed that incorporating additional textual\\nknowledge does not hinder model performance or introduce noise,\\nthus further validating the feasibility of utilizing large language\\nmodels to enhance spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.\\nSpatial Semantic Understanding : Accurately capturing spatial\\ncorrelations is crucial in the realm of spatio-temporal prediction.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 7\\n\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon23456 MAE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOurs\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon3456789101112131415 RMSE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOurs\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon12345 MAE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOurs\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon456789101112131415 RMSE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOursFigure 4: Time step-based prediction comparison experiment conducted on the CHI-taxi dataset.\\nTable 2: Evaluation of performance in the end-to-end super-\\nvised setting on the NYC-taxi and NYC-bike datasets.\\nModelNYC-taxi NYC-bike\\nInflow Outflow Inflow Outflow\\nMAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE\\nAGCRN 2.83 8.35 2.62 9.21 3.30 7.65 3.38 7.73\\nASTGCN 5.41 18.04 5.00 19.29 3.87 7.93 3.66 7.69\\nGWN 3.91 11.93 2.89 10.85 4.30 9.04 3.88 8.29\\nMTGNN 3.09 10.13 2.61 10.96 3.31 7.47 3.26 7.61\\nSTWA 3.90 12.64 3.15 11.32 4.23 9.07 4.18 9.18\\nSTSGCN 4.57 13.93 4.41 15.87 5.10 12.23 4.72 10.78\\nSTGCN 3.45 9.82 3.17 10.53 3.88 9.23 3.90 9.08\\nTGCN 3.99 11.47 3.31 11.58 4.12 7.92 4.11 7.84\\nDMVSTNET 3.83 11.55 2.76 9.88 3.71 7.95 3.69 7.92\\nST-LSTM 7.78 15.41 6.92 17.12 5.00 11.52 4.96 11.41\\nUrbanGPT 2.50 6.78 1.71 6.68 3.11 7.10 3.01 6.94\\nTraditional methods often employ graph networks or attention\\nmechanisms to analyze these correlations.

Our\\nrigorous testing primarily revolves around the zero-shot scenario\\nusing the NYC-taxi dataset. Through our analysis, we have distilled\\nthe benefits offered by the different modules into four key points.\\n\u2022(1) Impact of Spatial and Temporal Context :-STC . By re-\\nmoving time and spatial information from the instruction text,\\nwe observed a noticeable decline in the model\u2019s performance.\\nThis can be attributed to the lack of temporal information, forcing\\nthe model to rely solely on spatio-temporal encoders for encoding\\ntime-related features and performing prediction tasks. Furthermore,\\nthe absence of spatial information hindered the model\u2019s ability to\\ncapture spatial correlations, making it challenging to analyze the\\ndistinct spatio-temporal patterns of different areas.\\n\u2022(2) Impact of Instruction-Tuning with Diverse Datasets :-\\nMulti .

As a result, the model\u2019s per-\\nformance was suboptimal. By integrating diverse spatio-temporal\\ndata from multiple sources, our model can effectively capture the\\nunique characteristics of different geographical locations and their\\nevolving spatio-temporal patterns.\\n\u2022(3) Impact of Spatio-Temporal Encoder :-STE . In this vari-\\nant, we disable the spatio-temporal encoder to investigate its\\neffect on aligning the large language model with encoded urban\\ndependency dynamics into latent embedding space.\\nThe results clearly indicate that the absence of the spatio-temporal\\nencoder significantly hampers the performance of the large lan-\\nguage model in spatio-temporal prediction scenarios. This under-\\nscores the crucial role played by the proposed spatio-temporal\\nencoder in enhancing the model\u2019s predictive capabilities.\\n\u2022(4) Regression Layer Incorporation in Instruction-Tuning:\\nT2P. We explicitly instructed UrbanGPT to generate its predic-\\ntions in a textual format. However, the suboptimal performance\\nindicates the challenges in utilizing LLMs for precise numerical\\nregression tasks, as opposed to employing regression layers.\\nThe primary challenge stems from the model\u2019s dependence on\\nmulti-class loss for optimization during training, leading to a mis-\\nmatch between the model\u2019s probabilistic output and the continuous\\nvalue distribution necessary for spatio-temporal forecasting. To\\nbridge this gap, we incorporated a regression predictor into our\\nmodel, significantly improving its capacity to generate more precise\\nnumerical predictions for regression tasks.\\n4.5 Model Robustness Study (RQ4)\\nIn this section, we focus on evaluating the robustness of our Ur-\\nbanGPT across different spatio-temporal pattern scenarios. We cate-\\ngorize regions based on the magnitude of numerical variations, such\\nas taxi flow, during a specific time period. Lower variance indicates\\nstable temporal patterns, while higher variance suggests diverse\\nspatio-temporal patterns in active commercial zones or densely\\npopulated areas.

For a more comprehensive\\nunderstanding, please refer to the Appendix.\\n5 RELATED WORK\\nDeep Spatio-temporal Prediction Models . Deep spatio-temporal\\nprediction methods have gained prominence in deep learning due\\nto their impressive performance. These models typically consist of\\ntwo components: temporal dependency modeling and spatial corre-\\nlation encoding. Early models like D-LSTM [ 43] and ST-resnet [ 45]\\nused RNNs and convolutional networks to model temporal and\\nspatial dependencies. Graph neural networks (GNNs) proved to\\nbe a natural fit for spatial correlation modeling, as seen in models\\nlike STGCN [ 42] and DCRNN [ 14], which utilized graph structures\\nbased on node distances. Techniques such as learnable region-wise\\ngraph structures [ 36,37] and dynamic spatio-temporal graph net-\\nworks [9, 48] have further enhanced spatial correlation modeling.\\nFurthermore, researchers have explored approaches such as\\nmulti-scale temporal learning [ 34] and multi-granularity tempo-\\nral learning [ 8] to encode temporal dependencies. These strategies\\nenable the capture of features like long-term and short-term correla-\\ntions as well as periodicity. These advancements have significantlycontributed to the progress of spatio-temporal prediction. However,\\nit is worth noting that the majority of these studies are tailored\\nfor supervised contexts, with limited research and development\\nfocused on zero-shot spatio-temporal forecasting. This represents\\nan important area that requires further exploration.\\nSpatio-Temporal Pre-training . Spatio-temporal pre-training tech-\\nniques have recently received significant research attention. These\\ntechniques primarily focus on generative [ 16,24] and contrastive [ 46]\\npre-training models to enhance the predictive performance of down-\\nstream tasks. There has also been extensive exploration of pretrain-\\nfinetune frameworks for few-shot learning scenarios [ 13,19], aim-\\ning to improve knowledge transferability by aligning source and\\ntarget data. However, these approaches require training or fine-\\ntuning on target data and lack zero-shot prediction capabilities. In\\nthis work, we address the challenge of data scarcity in downstream\\nurban scenarios by proposing UrbanGPT. Our model demonstrates\\nthe ability to generalize well across various scenarios, mitigating\\nthe need for extensive training or fine-tuning on target data.\\nLarge Language Models. The emergence of large language mod-\\nels [3,21] has recently attracted significant attention due to their\\nunprecedented machine performance in tasks like text understand-\\ning and reasoning. These models have become a hot topic, demon-\\nstrating the potential to advance from intelligent algorithms to\\nartificial intelligence. Open-source large language models such as\\nLlama [ 28,29], Vicuna [ 50], and ChatGLM [ 44] have been released,\\nleading to researchers exploring their application in various fields\\nto enhance transfer learning capabilities with domain knowledge\\nfrom these models. In the computer vision domain, researchers\\nhave combined multimodal large language models with prompt\\nlearning methods to achieve zero-shot predictions in downstream\\ntasks [ 25,51,52]. Furthermore, the capabilities of LLMs in graph\\nreasoning [ 2,4,27], recommendation [ 10,23,35] and traffic anal-\\nysis [ 6] have been extensively studied. However, the utilization\\nof large language models for zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction\\ntasks in the field of urban intelligence remains largely unexplored.\\n6 CONCLUSION\\nWe present the UrbanGPT, a spatio-temporal large language model,\\nto generalize well in diverse urban scenarios. To seamlessly align\\nthe spatio-temporal contextual signals with LLMs, we introduce a\\nspatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm. This empowers the\\nUrbanGPT with the remarkable ability to learn universal and trans-\\nferable spatio-temporal patterns across various types of urban data.\\nThrough extensive experiments and meticulous ablation studies,\\nwe demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of the UrbanGPT\u2019s\\narchitecture and its key components. However, it is important to\\nacknowledge that while the results are promising, there are still\\nlimitations to be addressed in future studies. As a first step, we are\\nactively engaged in collecting a more diverse range of urban data\\nto enhance and refine the capabilities of our UrbanGPT across a\\nbroader spectrum of urban computing domains. Additionally, un-\\nderstanding the decision-making process of our UrbanGPT is of im-\\nportance. While the model demonstrates exceptional performance,\\nproviding interpretability and explainability is equally essential.\\nFuture research efforts will focus on empowering our model with\\nthe ability to interpret and explain its predictions.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 9\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n[1]Lei Bai, Lina Yao, Can Li, Xianzhi Wang, and Can Wang. 2020.

This includes detailed dataset informa-\\ntion, hyperparameter configuration, experimental setting for the\\ninstruction-tuning phase and test phase, as well as the baselines.\\nFurthermore, we present a case study of our UrbanGPT, showcasing\\nits effectiveness for zero-shot spatio-temporal predictions.\\nA.1 Experimental Details Description\\nA.1.1 Dataset Details. We collected data on taxi flows, bicycle\\nflows, and crime incidents in New York City for training and evalu-\\nation. The NYC-taxi dataset contains 263 regions, with each region\\nmeasuring approximately 3km x 3km. The time sampling inter-\\nval for this dataset is 30 minutes. The NYC-bike and NYC-crime\\ndatasets consist of 2162 regions, each represented by a 1km x 1km\\ngrid. The time sampling interval for NYC-bike is also 30 minutes,\\nwhile for NYC-crime, it is 1 day. All datasets cover the time period\\nfrom Jan 1, 2016, to Dec 31, 2021, in NYC. The CHI-taxi dataset\\nincludes 77 regions, with each region measuring approximately\\n4km x 4km. This dataset includes all taxi data from January 1, 2021,\\nto December 31, 2021, with a time sampling interval of 30 minutes.\\nA.1.2 Hyperparameters Settings. The parameters for the di-\\nlation convolution kernel in the time encoder are set as follows:\\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b,\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61, and\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61are all set to 32, with a dilation factor of 1. For\\nour prediction task, we aim to predict the next 12 steps of data\\nbased on the previous 12 steps. Both the history length ( \ud835\udc3b) and\\nprediction length ( \ud835\udc43) are set to 12. The projection layer parameters\\nare configured with \ud835\udc51set to 64 and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3fset to 4096. Lastly, the hidden\\nlayer parameter \ud835\udc51\u2032for the regression layer is set to 128.\\nA.1.3 Further Experimental Setup Descriptions. During the\\ninstruction-tuning phase, we randomly selected 80 regions from\\nthe three datasets in New York City as training data. It\u2019s important\\nto note that the region indices were kept consistent for the NYC-\\nbike and NYC-crime datasets. The training sets had specific time\\nintervals: for NYC-taxi datasets, it ranged from January 1, 2017,\\nto March 31, 2017; for NYC-bike datasets, it covered April 1, 2017,\\nto June 30, 2017; and for NYC-crime datasets, it spanned from\\nJanuary 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018. For the pretraining of the\\nspatio-temporal dependency encoder and the baseline models, we\\nutilized the same data for training to optimize the parameters. The\\nmaximum epoch count was set at 100. In the testing phase, we\\nconducted the following evaluations:\\n\u2022(i)Zero-Shot Prediction . We also selected an additional 80\\nregions from the New York City datasets as unseen test data. For\\nthe NYC-bike and NYC-taxi datasets, we used the first two weeks\\nof data in 2020 for testing. As for the NYC-crime dataset, we used\\nthe entire year of 2020 for testing. In the case of the Chicago city\\ndataset, we evaluated the model using all the data from Dec 2021.\\n\u2022(ii)Classical Supervised Prediction : For evaluation purposes,\\nwe chose the data with the longest time interval, which involved\\ntesting the model using all the data from the NYC-bike and NYC-\\ntaxi datasets specifically for the month of December 2021.\\nA.1.4 Baseline Details. To facilitate our discussion, we have\\ncategorized all the baselines into three distinct categories: RNN-\\nbased models, attention-based models, and graph neural network(GNN)-based spatio-temporal prediction models. Below, we provide\\ndetailed descriptions of each baseline category:\\nRNN-based Spatio-Temporal Methods:\\n\u2022ST-LSTM [33]: It incorporates the Long Short-Term Memory to\\ncapture temporal dependencies in the spatio-temporal data.\\n\u2022AGCRN [1]: RNNs are employed to capture temporal correlations,\\nallowing for the representation of the evolving patterns over time.\\n\u2022DMVSTNET [39]: In this method, RNNs are utilized to effectively\\nmodel temporal dependencies, capturing the patterns that evolve\\nover time. Furthermore, convolutional networks and fully con-\\nnected layers are employed to capture local spatial correlations\\nand establish meaningful spatial relationships.\\nAttention-based Spatio-Temporal Approaches:\\n\u2022ASTGCN [8]: In this method, attention mechanisms are employed\\nto capture multi-granularity temporal correlation features.\\n\u2022STWA [5]: The model incorporates personalized temporal and\\nspatial parameters into the attention module, allowing for the\\nmodeling of dynamic spatio-temporal correlations.\\nSpatio-Temporal GNNs:\\n\u2022GWN [37]: It incorporates a learnable graph structure and 1-D\\nconvolutions to effectively learn spatio-temporal dependencies.\\n\u2022MTGNN [36]: It utilizes a learnable graph structure to model\\nmultivariate temporal correlations. MTGNN employs 1-D dilation\\nconvolutions to generate temporal representations.\\n\u2022TGCN [47]: This model combines graph neural networks (GNNs)\\nfor spatial correlation modeling and recurrent neural networks\\n(RNNs) for temporal correlation modeling.\\n\u2022STGCN [42]: It uses gated temporal convolutions and GNNs to\\nmodel temporal and spatial dependencies, respectively.\\n\u2022STSGCN [26]: It introduces a spatio-temporal graph construction\\nto learn spatial correlations across adjacent time steps.\\nA.2 Case study\\nIn this section, we assess the effectiveness of different large lan-\\nguage models (LLMs) in zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction sce-\\nnarios, as illustrated in Table 3 and Table 4. The instructions pro-\\nvided to the models are clearly indicated in blue font. The results\\ndemonstrate that various LLMs are capable of generating predic-\\ntions based on these instructions, thereby highlighting the effective-\\nness of the prompt design. For instance, ChatGPT relies on historical\\naverages rather than explicitly incorporating temporal or spatial\\ndata in its predictions. Llama-2-70b analyzes specific time periods\\nand regions, but it encounters challenges in encoding numerical\\ntime-series dependencies, resulting in suboptimal predictive perfor-\\nmance. On the other hand, Claude-2.1 effectively summarizes and\\nanalyzes historical data, leveraging peak-hour patterns and points\\nof interest to achieve more accurate traffic trend predictions.\\nOur proposed UrbanGPT seamlessly integrates spatio-temporal\\ncontextual signals with the reasoning capabilities of large language\\nmodels (LLMs) through a spatio-temporal instruction-tuning para-\\ndigm. This integration leads to remarkable improvements in predict-\\ning numerical values and spatio-temporal trends. These findings\\nunderscore the potential and effectiveness of our framework in\\ncapturing universal spatio-temporal patterns, making zero-shot\\nspatio-temporal prediction practical and achievable.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 11\\n\\nTable 3: We examine the zero-shot predictions of different LLMs for bicycle flow in NYC with the provided instructions.\\nInstructions: Given the historical data for bike flow over 12 time steps in a specific region of New York City, the recorded bike inflows\\nare [12 8 9 15 10 12 14 9 6 12 25 20], and the recorded bike outflows are [5 12 12 15 10 11 6 9 4 6 10 15]. The recording time of the\\nhistorical data is \u2019January 14, 2020, 12:00, Tuesday to January 14, 2020, 17:30, Tuesday, with data points recorded at 30-minute intervals\u2019.\\nHere is the region information: This region is located within the Staten Island borough district and encompasses various POIs within a\\none-kilometer radius, covering Education Facility, Cultural Facility, Commercial, Transportation Facility categories. We now aim to\\npredict the bike inflow and outflow for the next 12 time steps during the time period of \u2019January 14, 2020, 18:00, Tuesday to January 14,\\n2020, 23:30, Tuesday, with data points recorded at 30-minute intervals\u2019. To improve prediction accuracy, a spatio-temporal model is\\nutilized to encode the historical bike data as tokens <ST_Start><ST_HIS><ST_HIS><ST_End>, where the first and the second tokens\\ncorrespond to the representations of bike inflow and outflow. Please conduct an analysis of the traffic patterns in this region, taking into\\naccount the provided time and regional information, and then generate the predictions (the predictive tokens for regression).\\nGround true: Based on the given information, the predictions of bike inflow and outflow in this region are [26 38 28 24 20 13 16 9 5 3\\n5 2] and[12 19 10 10 11 9 6 5 4 4 2 2] .\\nLlama-2-70b Responds: Based on the provided historical data, I have ... Here are my predictions for the bike inflow and outflow for the\\nnext 12 time steps:Bike Inflow: [15 18 20 15 12 10 14 12 10 15 18 20] . Bike Outflow: [10 12 15 10 11 12 10 9 6 10 12 15] .\\nThese predictions are based on the following analysis: Time of Day: The traffic patterns during this time are likely to be influenced by\\nthe evening rush hour, with increased bike inflows and outflows during the peak hours...Regional Information: ... This suggests that\\nthere may be a mix of both commuter and recreational bike traffic in the area...\\nChatGPT Responds: To analyze the traffic patterns in the given region and make predictions for the next 12 time steps, we can calculate\\nthe average bike inflow and outflow based on the historical data...

Predicted Bike Outflow: [9.58 9.58... 9.58] ...\\nClaude-2.1 Responds: Based on the provided historical data, this region in Staten Island seems to experience fluctuating yet relatively\\nlow bike traffic flow during the daytime on Tuesdays. The bike inflows range from 6 to 15 per 30-minute interval, while outflows range\\nfrom 4 to 15.Given the region covers education, cultural, commercial, and transportation facilities within a 1km radius, the bike traffic\\nlikely corresponds to people traveling to and from these points of interest. The fluctuations could reflect class/work schedules and\\ntransportation needs throughout the day.For the evening prediction period of 6PM to 11:30PM, we may expect some further fluctuations\\nbut generally declining bike traffic as the day turns to night. People would be finishing up activities and heading home. I would predict\\nthe following bike inflows and outflows for the next 12 time steps: [10 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 1 1] and[8 6 5 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 1 1] ...\\nUrbanGPT Responds: Based on the given information, the predictions (predicted tokens) of bike inflow and outflow in this region are\\n<ST_PRE> [20 21 22 21 17 12 9 7 6 5 5 5] and <ST_PRE> [11 10 8 7 6 6 5 4 4 3 3 2] .\\nTable 4: Zero-shot predictions of different LLMs for taxi flow in NYC with the provided instructions (without spatial information).\\nInstructions: Given the historical data for taxi flow over 12 time steps in a specific region of New York City, the recorded taxi inflows\\nare [111 86 90 78 49 75 46 32 20 14 9 9], and the recorded taxi outflows are [100 91 58 39 47 47 19 22 21 9 16 10].

No\\ndescription is available for this region. Now we want to predict the taxi inflow and outflow for the next 12 time steps during the time\\nperiod of \u2019January 6, 2020, 02:30, Monday to January 6, 2020, 08:00, Monday, with data points recorded at 30-minute intervals\u2019...\\nGround true: Based on the given information, the predictions of taxi inflow and outflow in this region are [9 3 3 4 6 3 30 22 58 74 91\\n110] and[5 10 7 15 11 19 43 46 90 146 213 187] .\\nLlama-2-70b Responds: Based on the provided historical data, I have analyzed the traffic patterns...

Predicted taxi outflows: [40.83 40.83... 40.83] ...\\nClaude-2.1 Responds: The data covers evening hours on a Sunday and early morning hours on a Monday. We can expect lower taxi\\ndemand during later Sunday evening, with some pickup around end-of-weekend times and early Monday commute times. The region\\nis unspecified, so we cannot infer any location-specific usage patterns. Inflow ranges from 49-111 taxis over the 30 minute intervals.\\nOutflow ranges from 19-100 taxis. This indicates the region likely serves both residential and commercial purposes.\\nPrediction: Inflows: [25 15 10 8 7 9 15 25 35 40 45 50] .

This has significant implications in the field\\nof urban computing, where the ability to predict transportation\\npatterns can optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance\\noverall urban mobility [ 18,31]. Moreover, anticipating population\\nmovement can aid in effective urban planning and resource alloca-\\ntion [ 7,20]. Additionally, the ability to forecast crimes can greatly\\ncontribute to enhancing public safety [ 32]. Spatio-temporal predic-\\ntion plays a vital role in shaping smarter and more efficient cities,\\nultimately leading to an improved quality of urban life.\\nIt is important to highlight the various types of neural network\\narchitectures commonly adopted in this domain of spatio-temporal\\nprediction. These architectures are designed to capture and model\\nthe complex relationships between spatial and temporal dimensions\\nin the data. One widely employed architecture is the Convolutional\\nNeural Network (CNN) [ 15,39,45], which is effective in extract-\\ning spatial features by applying convolutional filters across the\\ninput data. Another line of spatio-temporal neural networks is the\\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) family [ 1,34,43]. Those spatio-\\ntemporal RNNs are well-suited for capturing temporal dependencies\\nby maintaining a memory state that can retain information over\\ntime. Recently, there has been a surge in the use of Graph Neural\\nNetworks (GNNs) for spatio-temporal prediction [ 36,40,47]. GNNs\\nexcel in modeling complex spatial relationships in data represented\\nas graphs, where each node corresponds to a spatial location and\\nedges capture the connections between them.\\nWhile current spatio-temporal neural network techniques have\\nproven to be highly effective, it is crucial to acknowledge their\\nstrong dependence on having an abundance of labeled data in order\\nto generate accurate predictions. However, the pervasive problem\\nof data scarcity in practical urban sensing scenarios poses a sig-\\nnificant challenge. For example, deploying sensors throughout the\\nentire urban space to monitor citywide traffic volume or air qual-\\nity is impractical due to the high cost involved [ 17,41]. Moreover,\\nthe challenge of limited labeled data availability extends to spatio-\\ntemporal forecasting across different cities, in which acquiring\\nlabeled data for each target city becomes a daunting task [ 13,38].\\nThese issues emphasize the pressing need for novel solutions that\\naddress data scarcity and enhance the generalization capabilities of\\nspatio-temporal models in various smart city applications.\\nInspired by the remarkable progress of large language models\\n(LLMs), our primary goal is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that\\npossesses outstanding generalization capabilities across a wide\\narray of urban tasks. Leveraging the reasoning abilities inherent in\\nLLMs, we aim to expand their success into the domain of spatio-\\ntemporal analysis. Our objective is to develop a model that can\\neffectively comprehend and forecast intricate spatial and temporal\\npatterns, enabling it to excel in various urban scenarios.\\nWhile it is of utmost importance to develop a versatile spatio-\\ntemporal model capable of effectively handling diverse downstreamarXiv:2403.00813v3  [cs.CL]  19 May 2024\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 2\\n\\nInstruction s:Given thehistorical data fortaxiflow over 12time steps inaspecific region ofNew York City, the\\nrecorded taxiinflows are[9194100 939376676650695542],and therecorded taxioutflows are[9691108\\n10283787674106938657]\u2026Please predict thetaxiinflow and outflow fornext 12time steps\u2026\\nLabel s:Taxi Inflow :[5536333033273714167512]Taxi Outflow :[547069593231292120111312].\\nOurs :Based onthegiven information, thepredictions oftaxiinflow and outflow inthisregion are\u2026\\nPrediction :Inflow :[514845424038332824211816]Outflow :[544945413835302521181614].\\nHuman\\nInstructions\\nLLAMA -70BGround true\\nPrediction :Inflow :[282827262524232323232424]Outflow :[343128252219171616151515] Baseline\\nLLM :There isanoticeable spike intaxiinflows and outflows around 10:00-11:00,which may indicate asurge in\\ndemand fortaxiservices\u2026Ihave created apredictive model toforecast thetaxiflow forthenext 12time steps :\\nPrediction :Inflow :[53586460677378849196102 108]Outflow :[5661687379848995102 107 113 119]\\nUrbanGPT\\n2 4 6 8 10 12\\nTime Steps020406080100 Inflow Predicted valueBaseline\\nLLM\\nOurs\\nGround_true\\n2 4 6 8 10 12\\nTime Steps020406080100120 Outflow Predicted valueBaseline\\nLLM\\nOurs\\nGround_trueFigure 1: The superior predictive performance of the pro-\\nposed UrbanGPT compared to the large language model\\n(LLaMA-70B) and the spatiotemporal graph neural network\\n(STGCN) in a zero-shot traffic flow prediction scenario.\\ntasks, aligning the spatio-temporal context with the knowledge\\nspace of large language models (LLMs) and enabling them to com-\\nprehend the complex dependencies across time and space present\\nsignificant challenges. These hurdles call for meticulous model\\ndesign to bridge the gap between the unique characteristics of\\nspatio-temporal data and the knowledge encoded within LLMs.\\nContributions . In light of these challenges, we propose UrbanGPT,\\na large language model specifically tailored for spatio-temporal\\nprediction. At the core of UrbanGPT lies a novel spatio-temporal\\ninstruction-tuning paradigm that seeks to align the intricate de-\\npendencies of time and space, with the knowledge space of LLMs.\\nWithin our UrbanGPT framework, we start by incorporating a\\nspatio-temporal dependency encoder, which utilizes a multi-level\\ntemporal convolutional network. This encoder enables the model\\nto capture the intricate temporal dynamics present in the spatio-\\ntemporal data across various time resolutions. Then, our model\\ninvolves aligning textual and spatio-temporal information to em-\\npower language models in effectively injecting spatio-temporal\\ncontextual signals. This is achieved through the utilization of a\\nlightweight alignment module that projects the representations\\nof spatio-temporal dependencies. The result is the generation of\\nmore expressive semantic representations by integrating valuable\\ninformation from both textual and spatio-temporal domains.\\nThrough the incorporation of spatio-temporal information dur-\\ning the instruction-tuning process, the language model gains profi-\\nciency in understanding and processing the intricate relationships\\nand patterns found in spatio-temporal data. By leveraging the in-\\nsights obtained from the spatio-temporal domain, the language\\nmodel becomes better equipped to capture the nuances and com-\\nplexities of spatio-temporal phenomena. This, in turn, enables the\\nmodel to make more reliable and insightful predictions across vari-\\nous urban scenarios, even when faced with limited data availability.\\nTo showcase the superior predictive performance of our pro-\\nposed model, we compare it with the large language model (LLaMA-\\n70B) and the spatio-temporal graph neural network (STGCN) in azero-shot traffic flow prediction scenario guided by textual instruc-\\ntions, as depicted in Figure 1. The large language model, LLaMA,\\neffectively infers traffic patterns from the input text. However, its\\nlimitations in handling numeric time-series data with complex spa-\\ntial and temporal dependencies can sometimes lead to opposite\\ntraffic trend predictions. On the other hand, the pre-trained base-\\nline model demonstrates a strong understanding of spatio-temporal\\ndependencies. However, it may suffer from overfitting to the source\\ndataset and underperform in zero-shot scenarios, indicating its lim-\\nited generalization capabilities beyond existing spatio-temporal\\nprediction models. In contrast, our proposed model achieves a har-\\nmonious integration of domain-specific spatio-temporal knowledge\\nand language modeling capabilities. This enables us to make more\\naccurate and reliable predictions under data scarcity.\\nIn summary, our main contributions can be outlined as follows:\\n\u2022To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop\\na spatio-temporal large language model capable of predicting\\ndiverse urban phenomena across different datasets, especially\\nunder conditions of limited data availability.\\n\u2022We propose UrbanGPT, a spatio-temporal prediction framework\\nthat empowers large language models (LLMs) to comprehend\\nthe intricate inter-dependencies across time and space. This is\\nachieved through the seamless integration of a spatio-temporal\\ndependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm, ef-\\nfectively aligning the spatio-temporal context with LLMs.\\n\u2022Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets\\nprovide compelling evidence of our proposed UrbanGPT\u2019s excep-\\ntional ability to generalize in zero-shot spatio-temporal learning\\nscenarios. These findings highlight the model\u2019s robust general-\\nization capacity, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately\\npredicting and understanding spatio-temporal patterns, even in\\nscenarios where no prior training data is available.\\n2 PRELIMINARIES\\nSpatio-Temporal Data . Spatio-temporal data is commonly col-\\nlected and can be represented as a three-dimensional tensor X\u2208\\nR\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc47\u00d7\ud835\udc39. Each element X\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udc53in the tensor corresponds to the value\\nof the\ud835\udc53-th feature at the \ud835\udc61-th time interval in the \ud835\udc5f-th region. To\\nprovide an example, let\u2019s consider predicting taxi traffic patterns in\\nan urban area. In this scenario, the data can represent the inflow\\nand outflow of taxis in a specific region ( e.g., the\ud835\udc5f-th spatial area)\\nduring a given time period from \ud835\udc61to\ud835\udc61\u22121(e.g., a 30-minute interval).\\nSpatio-Temporal Forecasting. In spatio-temporal prediction tasks,\\na common scenario involves forecasting future trends using histor-\\nical data. Specifically, the goal is to predict the data for the next \ud835\udc43\\ntime steps based on information from the preceding \ud835\udc3bsteps.\\nX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+\ud835\udc43=\ud835\udc53(X\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e\u2212\ud835\udc3b+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e) (1)\\nThe function \ud835\udc53(\u00b7)represents a spatio-temporal prediction model\\nthat has been trained effectively using historical data. Spatio-temporal\\nprediction tasks can be divided into two main categories: regression\\nprediction, which involves predicting continuous values like traffic\\nflow or taxi demand [ 22], and classification prediction, where the\\ngoal is to classify events such as crime occurrence prediction [ 11].\\nTo optimize the model \ud835\udc53(\u00b7), different loss functions are utilized\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 3\\n\\nbased on the specific characteristics of the spatio-temporal scenar-\\nios.\\nSpatio-Temporal Zero-Shot Learning . Despite the effectiveness\\nof current spatio-temporal learning approaches, they often en-\\ncounter difficulties in effectively generalizing across a wide range of\\ndownstream spatio-temporal learning scenarios. In this study, our\\nfocus is on addressing the challenge of spatio-temporal zero-shot\\nscenarios, where we aim to learn from previously unseen data in\\ndownstream spatio-temporal prediction datasets or tasks. This can\\nbe formally defined as follows:\\n\u02dcX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+\ud835\udc43=\u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u02dcX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e\u2212\ud835\udc3b+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e) (2)\\nIn this particular scenario, the prediction function \u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u00b7)is responsi-\\nble for forecasting the spatio-temporal data \u02dcXfrom downstream\\ntasks that have not been previously encountered. It should be noted\\nthat the model \u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u00b7)is not trained specifically on the target data.\\n3 METHODOLOGY\\n3.1 Spatio-Temporal Dependency Encoder\\nAlthough large language models demonstrate exceptional profi-\\nciency in language processing, they face challenges in comprehend-\\ning the time-evolving patterns inherent in spatio-temporal data. To\\novercome this limitation, we propose enhancing the capability of\\nlarge language models to capture temporal dependencies within\\nspatio-temporal contexts. This is accomplished by integrating a\\nspatio-temporal encoder that incorporates a multi-level tempo-\\nral convolutional network. By doing so, we enable the model to\\neffectively capture the intricate temporal dependencies across vari-\\nous time resolutions, thereby improving its understanding of the\\ncomplex temporal dynamics present in the spatio-temporal data.\\nSpecifically, our spatio-temporal encoder is composed of two key\\ncomponents: a gated dilated convolution layer and a multi-level\\ncorrelation injection layer. Let\u2019s formalize this architecture as:\\n\u03a8(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f=(\u00afW(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc58\u2217E(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+\u00afb(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc58)\u00b7\ud835\udeff(\u00afW(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc54\u2217E(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+\u00afb(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc54)+E\u2032(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f (3)\\nWe begin with the initial spatio-temporal embedding, denoted as\\nE\ud835\udc5f\u2208R\ud835\udc47\u00d7\ud835\udc51. This embedding is obtained by enhancing the original\\ndata Xthrough a linear layer. To address the issue of gradient\\nvanishing, we utilize a slice of E\ud835\udc5f, denoted as E\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5f\u2208R\ud835\udc47\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51, which\\nis determined by the size of the dilated convolutional kernel. This\\nslice is employed for performing residual operations. To perform\\nthe residual operations, we use 1-D dilated convolution kernels\\n\u00afW\ud835\udc58and \u00afW\ud835\udc54\u2208R\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc54\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61, along with the corresponding bias\\nterms \u00afb\ud835\udc58and \u00afb\ud835\udc54\u2208R\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61. The sigmoid activation function \ud835\udeffis\\napplied to control the degree of information preservation during the\\nrepeated convolution operation. After the gated temporal dilated\\nconvolutional layer encoding, we are able to effectively capture the\\ntemporal dependencies across multiple time steps, resulting in the\\ngeneration of temporal representations.\\nThese representations contain different levels of temporal de-\\npendencies, reflecting various granularity-aware time-evolving pat-\\nterns. To preserve these informative patterns, we introduce a multi-\\nlevel correlation injection layer. This layer is designed to incorpo-\\nrate correlations between different levels and is formalized as:\\nS(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f=(W(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc60\u2217\u03a8(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+b(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc60)+S(\ud835\udc59\u22121)\\n\ud835\udc5f (4)We have the convolution kernel W\ud835\udc60\u2208R\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc46\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\u00d7\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61and the bias\\nvector b\ud835\udc60\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61. These are employed after \ud835\udc3flayers of encoding.\\nA simple non-linear layer is employed to merge the results from\\nequations 3 and 4, and the final spatio-temporal dependency repre-\\nsentations of are denoted as \u02dc\u03a8\u2208R\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc39\u00d7\ud835\udc51. To address the diverse\\nset of urban scenarios that may arise downstream, our proposed\\nspatio-temporal encoder is designed to be independent of graph\\nstructures when modeling spatial correlations. This is particularly\\ncrucial because in zero-shot prediction contexts, the spatial rela-\\ntionships between entities may be unknown or difficult to ascertain.\\nBy not relying on explicit graph structures, our encoder can effec-\\ntively handle a broad spectrum of urban scenarios, where spatial\\ncorrelations and dependencies can vary or be challenging to define\\nin advance. This flexibility enables our model to adapt and perform\\nwell, ensuring its applicability in a wide range of urban contexts.\\n3.2 Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning\\n3.2.1 Spatio-Temporal-Text Alignment. In order to enable lan-\\nguage models to effectively comprehend spatio-temporal patterns,\\nit is crucial to align textual and spatio-temporal information. This\\nalignment allows for the fusion of different modalities, resulting\\nin a more informative representation. By integrating contextual\\nfeatures from both textual and spatio-temporal domains, we can\\ncapture complementary information and extract higher-level se-\\nmantic representations that are more expressive and meaningful.\\nTo achieve this objective, we utilize a lightweight alignment mod-\\nule to project the spatio-temporal dependencies representations\\n\u02dc\u03a8. This projection involves the use of parameters W\ud835\udc5d\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f\\nandb\ud835\udc5d\u2208R\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, where\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3frepresents the commonly used hidden\\ndimension in language models (LLMs).\\nThe resulting projection, denoted as H\u2208R\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc39\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, are rep-\\nresented in the instructions using special tokens as: <ST_start>,\\n<ST_HIS>, ..., <ST_HIS>, <ST_end>. Here, <ST_start> and <ST_end>\\nserve as identifiers marking the beginning and end of the spatio-\\ntemporal token. These identifiers can be included in the large-\\nscale language model by expanding its vocabulary. The placeholder\\n<ST_HIS> represents the spatio-temporal token and corresponds to\\nthe projection Hin the hidden layer. By employing this technique,\\nthe model gains the ability to discern spatio-temporal dependen-\\ncies, thereby enhancing its proficiency in successfully performing\\nspatio-temporal predictive tasks within urban scenes.\\n3.2.2 Spatio-Temporal Prompt Instructions. In scenarios in-\\nvolving spatio-temporal prediction, both temporal and spatial in-\\nformation contain valuable semantic details that contribute to the\\nmodel\u2019s understanding of spatio-temporal patterns within specific\\ncontexts. For instance, traffic flow in the early morning differs sig-\\nnificantly from rush hour, and there are variations in traffic patterns\\nbetween commercial and residential areas. As a result, we recognize\\nthe potential of representing both temporal and spatial information\\nas prompt instruction text. We leverage the text understanding\\ncapabilities of large language models to encode this information,\\nenabling associative reasoning for downstream tasks.\\nIn our UrbanGPT framework, we integrate multi-granularity\\ntime information and spatial details as instruction inputs for the\\nlarge language model. Time information includes factors such as\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 4\\n\\nl = 1l = 2l = 3\\nGateSpatio -Temporal dependenc yencoder\\nLLMs spaceLightweight alignment moduleSpatio -Temporal Instruction -Tuning\\nGiven the historical data and the corresponding tokens\\n<ST_HIS> fortaxi flow \u2026The recording time \u2026This region\\nislocated \u2026Please generate thepredictive tokens for\u2026\\nBased onthe given information, the predictive tokens\\noftaxi inflow and outflow inthis region are<ST_PRE> \u2026\\nLarge Language Models\\nInflow\uff1a[28 26 20 33 49  50 48 34 40 22 \u2026]\\nOutflow\uff1a[40 52 58 32 22 10 18 19 20 24\u2026]City A\\nCity B\\n\u2026\\nInstruction -Tuning Zero -shot prediction\\n<ST_HIS> <ST_HIS> Multi -tasks\\nRegression Layer<ST_HIS> <ST_ PRE> \\ntokens\\nText Replacement\\nLlama VicunaAlignment\\nRegressionST Encoder\\nTask assignment\\nText instructionsInstructions\\nResponsesRegion A\\nRegion B\\nFrozen Trainable\\n\u2026\\nSpatio -Temporal Zero -shot prediction\\nTrain city\\nTest cityTrain region\\nTest region\\nST dependency representations ST Instruction -Tuning of LLMsFigure 2: The overall architecture of the proposed spatio-temporal language model UrbanGPT.\\nTemporal Information :The recording time ofthehistorical data is'January 7,2020 ,08:30,\\nTuesday toJanuary 7,2020 ,14:00,Tuesday, with data points recorded at30-minute intervals' .\\nSpatial Information :Here istheregion information :This region islocated within theStaten\\nIsland borough district and encompasses various POIs within athree -kilometer radius,\\ncovering Public Safety, Education Facility, Residential categories .\\nTask description :Now wewant topredict thetaxi inflow and outflow forthenext 12time\\nsteps during thetime period of'January 7,2020 ,14:30,Tuesday toJanuary 7,2020 ,20:00,\\nTuesday, with data points recorded at30-minute intervals' .\\nFigure 3: Illustration of spatio-temporal prompt instructions\\nencoding the time- and location-aware information.\\nthe day of the week and the hour of the day, while regional in-\\nformation encompasses the city, administrative areas, and nearby\\npoints of interest (POI) data, among others. By incorporating these\\ndiverse elements, UrbanGPT is capable of identifying and assimi-\\nlating spatio-temporal patterns across different regions and time-\\nframes. This enables the model to encapsulate these insights within\\ncomplex spatio-temporal contexts, thereby enhancing its ability\\nfor zero-shot reasoning. The design of the instructional text for\\nspatio-temporal information is illustrated in Figure 3.\\n3.2.3 Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning of LLMs. When\\nit comes to incorporating detailed spatio-temporal textual descrip-\\ntions, the next stage is to fine-tune large language models (LLMs)\\nusing instructions to generate spatio-temporal forecasts in textual\\nformat. However, this approach poses two challenges. Firstly , spatio-\\ntemporal forecasting typically relies on numerical data, which dif-\\nfers in structure and patterns from natural language that language\\nmodels excel at processing, focusing on semantic and syntactic rela-\\ntionships. Secondly , large language models are typically pre-trained\\nusing a multi-classification loss to predict vocabulary, resulting in a\\nprobability distribution of potential outcomes. This contrasts with\\nthe continuous value distribution required for regression tasks.\\nTo address these challenges, UrbanGPT adopts a different strat-\\negy by refraining from directly predicting future spatio-temporal\\nvalues. Instead, it generates forecasting tokens that aid in the pre-\\ndiction process. These tokens are subsequently passed through a\\nregression layer, which maps the hidden representations to generate\\nmore accurate predictive values. The formulation of the regressionlayer in our spatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm is:\\n\u02c6Y\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53=W3[\ud835\udf0e(W1H\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53),\ud835\udf0e(W2\u0393\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53)] (5)\\nThe prediction result, denoted as \u02c6Y\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53\u2208R\ud835\udc43, is obtained using the\\nrectified linear unit activation function, represented by \ud835\udf0e. The hid-\\nden representations of the forecasting tokens, denoted as \u0393\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53\u2208\\nR\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, are introduced as a novel term in the vocabulary of large lan-\\nguage models (LLMs). The regression layer is formulated using\\nweight matrices W1\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f,W2\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, and W3\u2208R\ud835\udc43\u00d72\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n,\\nwhere[\u00b7,\u00b7]represents the concatenation operation. While the prob-\\nability distribution of the forecasting tokens remains relatively\\nstable, their hidden representations contain rich spatio-temporal\\ncontextual attributes that capture dynamic spatio-temporal interde-\\npendencies. This enables our model to provide precise predictions\\nby leveraging this contextual information.\\n3.3 Model Optimization\\nBuilding upon the baseline model [ 1,8], we adopt the absolute error\\nloss as our regression loss function. This choice allows us to effec-\\ntively handle predictions across a wide range of urban scenarios.\\nAdditionally, we introduce a classification loss as a joint loss to\\ncater to diverse task requirements. To ensure optimal performance,\\nour model optimizes different losses based on the specific task in-\\nputs. For instance, we utilize the regression loss for tasks such as\\ntraffic flow prediction, while employing the classification loss for\\ntasks like crime prediction. This approach enables our model to\\neffectively address the unique challenges posed by each task and\\ndeliver accurate predictions in various urban scenarios.\\nL\ud835\udc50=\u22121\\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01\\n\ud835\udc56=1[\ud835\udeff(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)\u00b7log(\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)+(1\u2212\ud835\udeff(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56))\u00b7log(1\u2212\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)]\\nL\ud835\udc5f=1\\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01\\n\ud835\udc56=1|\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\u2212\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56|;L=L\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc60+L\ud835\udc5f+L\ud835\udc50 (6)\\nHere,\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56represents a sample from \u02c6Y, and\ud835\udc41represents the total\\nnumber of samples, which is calculated as the product of \ud835\udc45,\ud835\udc47, and\\n\ud835\udc39. We use various loss functions in our model, including L\ud835\udc50for\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 5\\n\\nbinary cross-entropy loss, L\ud835\udc5ffor regression loss, and the cross-\\nentropy loss adopted in our spatio-temporal language models. To\\ncapture probability distributions from the prediction, we employ\\nthe sigmoid function denoted by \ud835\udeff. Each of these loss functions\\nplays a specific role in our model, allowing us to effectively handle\\nclassification, regression, and language modeling tasks as needed.\\n4 EVALUATION\\nIn this section, we aim to assess the capabilities of our proposed\\nmodel across various settings by addressing five key questions:\\n\u2022RQ1 : What is the performance and generalization capability of\\nUrbanGPT in diverse zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction tasks?\\n\u2022RQ2 : How does UrbanGPT perform when compared to existing\\nspatio-temporal models in classical supervised scenarios?\\n\u2022RQ3 : What specific contributions do the proposed key compo-\\nnents bring to enhance the capabilities of our UrbanGPT model?\\n\u2022RQ4 : Can the proposed model robustly handle the forecasting\\nscenarios with varying spatio-temporal patterns?\\n4.1 Experimental Setting\\n4.1.1 Dataset Description. To evaluate the effectiveness of the\\nproposed model in predicting spatio-temporal patterns across var-\\nious urban computing scenarios, we conducted experiments us-\\ning four distinct datasets: NYC-taxi, NYC-bike, NYC-crime, and\\nCHI-taxi. These datasets encompass a wide range of data sources\\nto capture the dynamic nature of urban environments, including\\nrecords of taxi travel, bike trajectories, crime incidents in New York\\nCity, and taxi travel data in Chicago. To facilitate our analysis, we\\npartitioned the cities into grid-like regions based on latitude and\\nlongitude information. Within specific time intervals, we aggre-\\ngated statistical measures for each region. For example, this in-\\nvolved calculating the number of taxi inflows and outflows within\\na 30-minute period in region A, or determining the count of theft\\nincidents within a day in region B. Furthermore, Points of Interest\\n(POIs) data can be obtained through APIs provided by map services,\\nutilizing the latitude and longitude of different regions. For more\\ncomprehensive data descriptions, please refer to the Appendix.\\n4.1.2 Evaluation Protocols. In order to investigate the capabili-\\nties of large language models in analyzing diverse spatio-temporal\\ndata across different regions, we selected a subset of taxi, bike, and\\ncrime data from various areas of New York City as our training set.\\n\u2022Zero-Shot Learning Scenarios . We assessed the model perfor-\\nmance by predicting future spatio-temporal data from regions in\\nNYC or even Chicago that were unseen in the training phase.\\n\u2022Supervised Learning Scenarios . We evaluated the model using\\nfuture data from the same regions as the training set.\\nFor regression tasks, we maintained a consistent training and test-\\ning methodology across all baseline models. When it came to classi-\\nfication tasks involving crime data, we utilized binary cross-entropy\\nas the loss function for training and testing the models. Our ex-\\nperiments were conducted using the robust vicuna-7b [ 50] as the\\nfoundational large language model for UrbanGPT. For a more com-\\nprehensive understanding of our methodology and experimental\\nsetup, please refer to the appendix for detailed information.4.1.3 Evaluation Metrics. For regression tasks, we employed\\nMAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)\\nas evaluation metrics. These metrics quantify the discrepancies\\nbetween the predicted outcomes and the actual labels, with lower\\nvalues indicating superior performance [ 12,49]. In the case of clas-\\nsification tasks, we utilized Recall and Macro-F1 as evaluation met-\\nrics to assess performance. Recall measures the model\u2019s ability to\\ncorrectly identify positive instances, while Macro-F1 is a compre-\\nhensive performance metric that combines precision and recall to\\nprovide an overall measure of classification accuracy [11, 30].\\n4.1.4 Baseline Model. We conducted a thorough comparison\\nwith 10 advanced models to establish baselines for our proposed\\nmethod. (i)In the category of RNNs-based spatio-temporal forecast-\\ning methods, we compared our proposed method with AGCRN [ 1],\\nDMVSTNET [ 39] and ST-LSTM [ 33]. These approaches leverage\\nRNNs for modeling and prediction. (ii)The GNNs-based spatio-\\ntemporal models primarily utilize graph neural networks to cap-\\nture spatial correlations and integrate temporal encoders to capture\\nspatio-temporal relationships. The models we compared against\\nin this category include GWN [ 37], MTGNN [ 36], STSGCN [ 26],\\nTGCN [ 47], and STGCN [ 42].(iii) In the attention-based spatio-\\ntemporal models category, the methods employ attention mecha-\\nnisms to model spatio-temporal correlations. The models we com-\\npared against in this category are ASTGCN [8] and STWA [5].\\n4.2 Zero-Shot Prediction Performance (RQ1)\\nIn this section, we thoroughly evaluate the predictive performance\\nof our proposed model in zero-shot scenarios. The results of our\\nevaluation are presented in Table 1 and visualized in Figure 4. Our\\nobjective is to assess the model\u2019s effectiveness in predicting spatio-\\ntemporal patterns in geographical areas that it has not encountered\\nduring training. This evaluation encompasses both cross-region\\nand cross-city settings, allowing us to gain insights into the model\u2019s\\ngeneralization capabilities across different locations.\\n4.2.1 Prediction on Unseen Regions within a City. Cross-\\nregion scenarios entail using data from certain regions within a\\ncity to forecast future conditions in other regions that have not\\nbeen encountered by the model. Through a thorough analysis of\\nthe model\u2019s performance in these cross-region predictions, we can\\ndraw attention to three significant observations:\\ni) Superior Zero-shot Predictive Performance . The results pre-\\nsented in Table 1 highlight the exceptional performance of our\\nproposed model in both regression and classification tasks on vari-\\nous datasets, surpassing the baseline models in zero-shot prediction.\\nThe success of our model can be attributed to two key factors.\\n\u2022Spatio-Temporal-Text-Alignment . The alignment of spatio-\\ntemporal contextual signals with the text comprehension abil-\\nities of language models plays a pivotal role in the success of\\nour proposed model. This fusion enables the model to effectively\\ncapitalize on both the encoded urban dynamics from the spa-\\ntiotemporal signals and the comprehensive understanding of\\ntextual context provided by the LLMs. By leveraging these two\\nessential aspects, our model achieves the remarkable ability to\\ngeneralize its prediction capabilities in zero-shot scenarios.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 6\\n\\nTable 1: Our model\u2019s performance in zero-shot prediction is evaluated on three diverse datasets: NYC-taxi, NYC-bike, and\\nNYC-crime, providing a comprehensive assessment of its predictive capabilities in unseen situations.\\nModelDataset NYC-taxi NYC-bike NYC-crime\\nType Inflow Outflow Inflow Outflow Burglary Robbery\\nMetrics MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE Macro-F1 Recall Macro-F1 Recall\\nAGCRN 10.86 26.51 13.15 36.45 3.41 7.98 3.42 8.08 0.48 0.00 0.49 0.01\\nASTGCN 9.75 24.12 12.42 33.28 5.58 11.58 5.78 12.29 0.49 0.01 0.55 0.09\\nGWN 10.73 26.50 9.67 26.74 3.32 8.17 3.07 7.52 0.48 0.00 0.52 0.04\\nMTGNN 10.16 25.84 12.59 35.38 3.18 7.62 3.20 7.65 0.64 0.27 0.65 0.30\\nSTWA 11.28 28.97 13.54 38.61 4.59 10.94 4.35 10.67 0.48 0.00 0.51 0.03\\nSTSGCN 18.97 41.38 20.07 45.79 6.85 14.98 6.54 14.77 0.48 0.00 0.48 0.00\\nSTGCN 12.54 30.80 14.32 39.58 4.11 9.21 4.45 9.62 0.48 0.00 0.64 0.30\\nTGCN 10.04 25.10 10.98 30.03 2.88 6.55 2.91 6.42 0.56 0.10 0.58 0.13\\nDMVSTNET 11.00 28.29 10.59 29.20 3.80 9.87 3.65 9.21 0.48 0.01 0.59 0.15\\nST-LSTM 16.97 34.43 18.93 44.10 7.78 15.41 6.92 17.12 0.48 0.00 0.49 0.03\\nUrbanGPT 6.16 16.92 6.83 21.78 2.02 5.16 2.01 5.03 0.67 0.34 0.69 0.42\\n\u2022Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning . This adaptive tuning\\nprocess empowers the LLM to effectively integrate crucial in-\\nformation from the instructions, enhancing its comprehension\\nof the complex relationships and dependencies between spatial\\nand temporal factors. By seamlessly merging the spatio-temporal\\ninstruction-tuning with the spatio-temporal dependency encoder,\\nour proposed model, UrbanGPT, successfully preserves universal\\nand transferable spatio-temporal knowledge. Consequently, the\\nmodel becomes capable of capturing the fundamental patterns\\nand dynamics that govern spatio-temporal phenomena, enabling\\nit to make precise predictions in downstream zero-shot scenarios.\\nii) Enhanced Urban Semantic Understanding . Urban seman-\\ntics offer valuable insights into the diverse dimensions of spatial\\nand temporal characteristics. Our approach involves training our\\nmodel on a wide range of datasets, enriching its understanding\\nof spatio-temporal dynamics across different timeframes and geo-\\ngraphical locations. In contrast, baseline models tend to prioritize\\nencoding temporal and spatial dependencies, neglecting the nu-\\nanced semantics that differentiate regions, timeframes, and data\\ncategories. By incorporating comprehensive semantic awareness\\ninto our UrbanGPT, we significantly enhance its ability to make\\naccurate zero-shot predictions in previously unseen regions.\\niii) Improved Performance in Sparse Data Scenarios . Predict-\\ning spatio-temporal patterns in sparse data environments is chal-\\nlenging as models tend to overfit when data points are scarce. This\\nchallenge is particularly notable when predicting crimes, where data\\nis often sparse but crucial for accurate predictions. Baseline mod-\\nels struggle in cross-regional prediction tasks under these sparse\\nconditions, resulting in low recall scores that indicate potential over-\\nfitting. To overcome this limitation, our model integrates spatio-\\ntemporal learning with large language models (LLMs) using an\\neffective spatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm. By incorpo-\\nrating rich semantic insights, our approach enhances the model\u2019s\\nspatio-temporal representations, enabling it to effectively handle\\nsparse data and achieve improved prediction accuracy.\\n4.2.2 Cross-City Prediction Task. To assess the performance of\\nour model in cross-city prediction tasks, we conducted tests on the\\nCHI-taxi dataset, which was not seen during the training phase. The\\nresults, depicted in Figure 4, yielded the following observations:\u2022Consistency in Multi-step Prediction : Our model consistently\\noutperforms the comparison method at each time step. Notably,\\nit maintains a significant advantage in both short-term and long-\\nterm spatio-temporal prediction, demonstrating the robustness\\nof our proposed model in cross-city prediction scenarios.\\n\u2022Effective Knowledge Transfer Across Cities : The prediction\\nresults obtained from the CHI-taxi dataset validate the supe-\\nrior forecasting capabilities of our model in cross-city scenarios.\\nThis enhancement can be attributed to the integration of spatio-\\ntemporal encoders with the spatio-temporal instruction-tuning\\nparadigm. By incorporating these components, our model ef-\\nfectively captures universal and transferable spatio-temporal\\npatterns, allowing it to make accurate predictions. Additionally,\\nby considering different geographical information and temporal\\nfactors alongside the learned transferred knowledge, our model\\nsuccessfully associates spatio-temporal patterns exhibited by\\nsimilar functional areas and historical periods. This comprehen-\\nsive understanding provides valuable insights for making precise\\nzero-shot predictions in cross-city scenarios.\\n4.3 Classical Supervised Prediction Task (RQ2)\\nThis section examines the predictive capabilities of our UrbanGPT\\nin end-to-end supervised prediction scenarios, as presented in Ta-\\nble 2. We will discuss the results from two perspectives below.\\nEnhanced Long-Term Forecasting Abilities : We examined the\\nmodel\u2019s effectiveness in long-term spatio-temporal forecasting by\\nutilizing test datasets that spanned broader time intervals. For in-\\nstance, we trained the model using data from 2017 and evaluated its\\nperformance on data from 2021.

Models lacking dedi-\\ncated spatial correlation modules, like LSTM, tend to underperform\\nas they overlook the spatial context. In contrast, our model com-\\npensates for the absence of explicit spatial encoders by integrating\\nextensive geographic and points of interest (POIs) data within the\\ntextual input. This approach enables the model to comprehend the\\nshared characteristics of areas with similar functions at a higher\\nsemantic level. Consequently, it deduces patterns of correlation\\nbetween various functional zones and effectively represents the\\ninterconnections among different regions.\\n4.4 Ablation study (RQ3)\\nThis section investigates the impact of different key components\\non the performance of our model, as illustrated in Figure 5. Our\\nrigorous testing primarily revolves around the zero-shot scenario\\nusing the NYC-taxi dataset. Through our analysis, we have distilled\\nthe benefits offered by the different modules into four key points.\\n\u2022(1) Impact of Spatial and Temporal Context :-STC . By re-\\nmoving time and spatial information from the instruction text,\\nwe observed a noticeable decline in the model\u2019s performance.\\nThis can be attributed to the lack of temporal information, forcing\\nthe model to rely solely on spatio-temporal encoders for encoding\\ntime-related features and performing prediction tasks. Furthermore,\\nthe absence of spatial information hindered the model\u2019s ability to\\ncapture spatial correlations, making it challenging to analyze the\\ndistinct spatio-temporal patterns of different areas.\\n\u2022(2) Impact of Instruction-Tuning with Diverse Datasets :-\\nMulti . We conducted our training solely on the NYC-taxi data to\\nexamine whether incorporating multiple datasets would provide\\nvaluable insights to the LLMs in zero-shot scenarios.\\n-STC -Multi -STE Ours -T2P\\nNYC-taxi inflow6.06.26.46.66.87.0 MAE\\nNYC-taxi inflow16.817.217.618.0 RMSE\\nNYC-taxi outflow6.66.87.07.27.47.67.88.0 MAE\\nNYC-taxi outflow21.522.022.523.023.524.024.5 RMSEFigure 5: Ablation study of our proposed UrbanGPT.\\nHowever, this restricted training approach limited the model\u2019s\\nability to fully uncover the spatio-temporal dynamics of cities due to\\nthe absence of diverse urban indicators. As a result, the model\u2019s per-\\nformance was suboptimal. By integrating diverse spatio-temporal\\ndata from multiple sources, our model can effectively capture the\\nunique characteristics of different geographical locations and their\\nevolving spatio-temporal patterns.\\n\u2022(3) Impact of Spatio-Temporal Encoder :-STE . In this vari-\\nant, we disable the spatio-temporal encoder to investigate its\\neffect on aligning the large language model with encoded urban\\ndependency dynamics into latent embedding space.\\nThe results clearly indicate that the absence of the spatio-temporal\\nencoder significantly hampers the performance of the large lan-\\nguage model in spatio-temporal prediction scenarios. This under-\\nscores the crucial role played by the proposed spatio-temporal\\nencoder in enhancing the model\u2019s predictive capabilities.\\n\u2022(4) Regression Layer Incorporation in Instruction-Tuning:\\nT2P. We explicitly instructed UrbanGPT to generate its predic-\\ntions in a textual format. However, the suboptimal performance\\nindicates the challenges in utilizing LLMs for precise numerical\\nregression tasks, as opposed to employing regression layers.\\nThe primary challenge stems from the model\u2019s dependence on\\nmulti-class loss for optimization during training, leading to a mis-\\nmatch between the model\u2019s probabilistic output and the continuous\\nvalue distribution necessary for spatio-temporal forecasting. To\\nbridge this gap, we incorporated a regression predictor into our\\nmodel, significantly improving its capacity to generate more precise\\nnumerical predictions for regression tasks.\\n4.5 Model Robustness Study (RQ4)\\nIn this section, we focus on evaluating the robustness of our Ur-\\nbanGPT across different spatio-temporal pattern scenarios. We cate-\\ngorize regions based on the magnitude of numerical variations, such\\nas taxi flow, during a specific time period. Lower variance indicates\\nstable temporal patterns, while higher variance suggests diverse\\nspatio-temporal patterns in active commercial zones or densely\\npopulated areas.

Deep spatio-temporal\\nprediction methods have gained prominence in deep learning due\\nto their impressive performance. These models typically consist of\\ntwo components: temporal dependency modeling and spatial corre-\\nlation encoding. Early models like D-LSTM [ 43] and ST-resnet [ 45]\\nused RNNs and convolutional networks to model temporal and\\nspatial dependencies. Graph neural networks (GNNs) proved to\\nbe a natural fit for spatial correlation modeling, as seen in models\\nlike STGCN [ 42] and DCRNN [ 14], which utilized graph structures\\nbased on node distances. Techniques such as learnable region-wise\\ngraph structures [ 36,37] and dynamic spatio-temporal graph net-\\nworks [9, 48] have further enhanced spatial correlation modeling.\\nFurthermore, researchers have explored approaches such as\\nmulti-scale temporal learning [ 34] and multi-granularity tempo-\\nral learning [ 8] to encode temporal dependencies. These strategies\\nenable the capture of features like long-term and short-term correla-\\ntions as well as periodicity. These advancements have significantlycontributed to the progress of spatio-temporal prediction. However,\\nit is worth noting that the majority of these studies are tailored\\nfor supervised contexts, with limited research and development\\nfocused on zero-shot spatio-temporal forecasting. This represents\\nan important area that requires further exploration.\\nSpatio-Temporal Pre-training . Spatio-temporal pre-training tech-\\nniques have recently received significant research attention. These\\ntechniques primarily focus on generative [ 16,24] and contrastive [ 46]\\npre-training models to enhance the predictive performance of down-\\nstream tasks. There has also been extensive exploration of pretrain-\\nfinetune frameworks for few-shot learning scenarios [ 13,19], aim-\\ning to improve knowledge transferability by aligning source and\\ntarget data. However, these approaches require training or fine-\\ntuning on target data and lack zero-shot prediction capabilities. In\\nthis work, we address the challenge of data scarcity in downstream\\nurban scenarios by proposing UrbanGPT. Our model demonstrates\\nthe ability to generalize well across various scenarios, mitigating\\nthe need for extensive training or fine-tuning on target data.\\nLarge Language Models. The emergence of large language mod-\\nels [3,21] has recently attracted significant attention due to their\\nunprecedented machine performance in tasks like text understand-\\ning and reasoning. These models have become a hot topic, demon-\\nstrating the potential to advance from intelligent algorithms to\\nartificial intelligence. Open-source large language models such as\\nLlama [ 28,29], Vicuna [ 50], and ChatGLM [ 44] have been released,\\nleading to researchers exploring their application in various fields\\nto enhance transfer learning capabilities with domain knowledge\\nfrom these models. In the computer vision domain, researchers\\nhave combined multimodal large language models with prompt\\nlearning methods to achieve zero-shot predictions in downstream\\ntasks [ 25,51,52]. Furthermore, the capabilities of LLMs in graph\\nreasoning [ 2,4,27], recommendation [ 10,23,35] and traffic anal-\\nysis [ 6] have been extensively studied. However, the utilization\\nof large language models for zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction\\ntasks in the field of urban intelligence remains largely unexplored.\\n6 CONCLUSION\\nWe present the UrbanGPT, a spatio-temporal large language model,\\nto generalize well in diverse urban scenarios. To seamlessly align\\nthe spatio-temporal contextual signals with LLMs, we introduce a\\nspatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm. This empowers the\\nUrbanGPT with the remarkable ability to learn universal and trans-\\nferable spatio-temporal patterns across various types of urban data.\\nThrough extensive experiments and meticulous ablation studies,\\nwe demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of the UrbanGPT\u2019s\\narchitecture and its key components. However, it is important to\\nacknowledge that while the results are promising, there are still\\nlimitations to be addressed in future studies. As a first step, we are\\nactively engaged in collecting a more diverse range of urban data\\nto enhance and refine the capabilities of our UrbanGPT across a\\nbroader spectrum of urban computing domains. Additionally, un-\\nderstanding the decision-making process of our UrbanGPT is of im-\\nportance. While the model demonstrates exceptional performance,\\nproviding interpretability and explainability is equally essential.\\nFuture research efforts will focus on empowering our model with\\nthe ability to interpret and explain its predictions.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 9\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n[1]Lei Bai, Lina Yao, Can Li, Xianzhi Wang, and Can Wang. 2020.

The parameters for the di-\\nlation convolution kernel in the time encoder are set as follows:\\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b,\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61, and\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61are all set to 32, with a dilation factor of 1. For\\nour prediction task, we aim to predict the next 12 steps of data\\nbased on the previous 12 steps. Both the history length ( \ud835\udc3b) and\\nprediction length ( \ud835\udc43) are set to 12. The projection layer parameters\\nare configured with \ud835\udc51set to 64 and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3fset to 4096. Lastly, the hidden\\nlayer parameter \ud835\udc51\u2032for the regression layer is set to 128.\\nA.1.3 Further Experimental Setup Descriptions. During the\\ninstruction-tuning phase, we randomly selected 80 regions from\\nthe three datasets in New York City as training data. It\u2019s important\\nto note that the region indices were kept consistent for the NYC-\\nbike and NYC-crime datasets. The training sets had specific time\\nintervals: for NYC-taxi datasets, it ranged from January 1, 2017,\\nto March 31, 2017; for NYC-bike datasets, it covered April 1, 2017,\\nto June 30, 2017; and for NYC-crime datasets, it spanned from\\nJanuary 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018. For the pretraining of the\\nspatio-temporal dependency encoder and the baseline models, we\\nutilized the same data for training to optimize the parameters. The\\nmaximum epoch count was set at 100. In the testing phase, we\\nconducted the following evaluations:\\n\u2022(i)Zero-Shot Prediction . We also selected an additional 80\\nregions from the New York City datasets as unseen test data. For\\nthe NYC-bike and NYC-taxi datasets, we used the first two weeks\\nof data in 2020 for testing. As for the NYC-crime dataset, we used\\nthe entire year of 2020 for testing. In the case of the Chicago city\\ndataset, we evaluated the model using all the data from Dec 2021.\\n\u2022(ii)Classical Supervised Prediction : For evaluation purposes,\\nwe chose the data with the longest time interval, which involved\\ntesting the model using all the data from the NYC-bike and NYC-\\ntaxi datasets specifically for the month of December 2021.\\nA.1.4 Baseline Details. To facilitate our discussion, we have\\ncategorized all the baselines into three distinct categories: RNN-\\nbased models, attention-based models, and graph neural network(GNN)-based spatio-temporal prediction models. Below, we provide\\ndetailed descriptions of each baseline category:\\nRNN-based Spatio-Temporal Methods:\\n\u2022ST-LSTM [33]: It incorporates the Long Short-Term Memory to\\ncapture temporal dependencies in the spatio-temporal data.\\n\u2022AGCRN [1]: RNNs are employed to capture temporal correlations,\\nallowing for the representation of the evolving patterns over time.\\n\u2022DMVSTNET [39]: In this method, RNNs are utilized to effectively\\nmodel temporal dependencies, capturing the patterns that evolve\\nover time. Furthermore, convolutional networks and fully con-\\nnected layers are employed to capture local spatial correlations\\nand establish meaningful spatial relationships.\\nAttention-based Spatio-Temporal Approaches:\\n\u2022ASTGCN [8]: In this method, attention mechanisms are employed\\nto capture multi-granularity temporal correlation features.\\n\u2022STWA [5]: The model incorporates personalized temporal and\\nspatial parameters into the attention module, allowing for the\\nmodeling of dynamic spatio-temporal correlations.\\nSpatio-Temporal GNNs:\\n\u2022GWN [37]: It incorporates a learnable graph structure and 1-D\\nconvolutions to effectively learn spatio-temporal dependencies.\\n\u2022MTGNN [36]: It utilizes a learnable graph structure to model\\nmultivariate temporal correlations. MTGNN employs 1-D dilation\\nconvolutions to generate temporal representations.\\n\u2022TGCN [47]: This model combines graph neural networks (GNNs)\\nfor spatial correlation modeling and recurrent neural networks\\n(RNNs) for temporal correlation modeling.\\n\u2022STGCN [42]: It uses gated temporal convolutions and GNNs to\\nmodel temporal and spatial dependencies, respectively.\\n\u2022STSGCN [26]: It introduces a spatio-temporal graph construction\\nto learn spatial correlations across adjacent time steps.\\nA.2 Case study\\nIn this section, we assess the effectiveness of different large lan-\\nguage models (LLMs) in zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction sce-\\nnarios, as illustrated in Table 3 and Table 4. The instructions pro-\\nvided to the models are clearly indicated in blue font. The results\\ndemonstrate that various LLMs are capable of generating predic-\\ntions based on these instructions, thereby highlighting the effective-\\nness of the prompt design. For instance, ChatGPT relies on historical\\naverages rather than explicitly incorporating temporal or spatial\\ndata in its predictions. Llama-2-70b analyzes specific time periods\\nand regions, but it encounters challenges in encoding numerical\\ntime-series dependencies, resulting in suboptimal predictive perfor-\\nmance. On the other hand, Claude-2.1 effectively summarizes and\\nanalyzes historical data, leveraging peak-hour patterns and points\\nof interest to achieve more accurate traffic trend predictions.\\nOur proposed UrbanGPT seamlessly integrates spatio-temporal\\ncontextual signals with the reasoning capabilities of large language\\nmodels (LLMs) through a spatio-temporal instruction-tuning para-\\ndigm. This integration leads to remarkable improvements in predict-\\ning numerical values and spatio-temporal trends. These findings\\nunderscore the potential and effectiveness of our framework in\\ncapturing universal spatio-temporal patterns, making zero-shot\\nspatio-temporal prediction practical and achievable.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 11\\n\\nTable 3: We examine the zero-shot predictions of different LLMs for bicycle flow in NYC with the provided instructions.\\nInstructions: Given the historical data for bike flow over 12 time steps in a specific region of New York City, the recorded bike inflows\\nare [12 8 9 15 10 12 14 9 6 12 25 20], and the recorded bike outflows are [5 12 12 15 10 11 6 9 4 6 10 15].

To improve prediction accuracy, a spatio-temporal model is\\nutilized to encode the historical bike data as tokens <ST_Start><ST_HIS><ST_HIS><ST_End>, where the first and the second tokens\\ncorrespond to the representations of bike inflow and outflow. Please conduct an analysis of the traffic patterns in this region, taking into\\naccount the provided time and regional information, and then generate the predictions (the predictive tokens for regression).\\nGround true: Based on the given information, the predictions of bike inflow and outflow in this region are [26 38 28 24 20 13 16 9 5 3\\n5 2] and[12 19 10 10 11 9 6 5 4 4 2 2] .\\nLlama-2-70b Responds: Based on the provided historical data, I have ...

The bike inflows range from 6 to 15 per 30-minute interval, while outflows range\\nfrom 4 to 15.Given the region covers education, cultural, commercial, and transportation facilities within a 1km radius, the bike traffic\\nlikely corresponds to people traveling to and from these points of interest. The fluctuations could reflect class/work schedules and\\ntransportation needs throughout the day.For the evening prediction period of 6PM to 11:30PM, we may expect some further fluctuations\\nbut generally declining bike traffic as the day turns to night. People would be finishing up activities and heading home.

We can expect lower taxi\\ndemand during later Sunday evening, with some pickup around end-of-weekend times and early Monday commute times. The region\\nis unspecified, so we cannot infer any location-specific usage patterns. Inflow ranges from 49-111 taxis over the 30 minute intervals.\\nOutflow ranges from 19-100 taxis.

This has significant implications in the field\\nof urban computing, where the ability to predict transportation\\npatterns can optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance\\noverall urban mobility [ 18,31]. Moreover, anticipating population\\nmovement can aid in effective urban planning and resource alloca-\\ntion [ 7,20]. Additionally, the ability to forecast crimes can greatly\\ncontribute to enhancing public safety [ 32]. Spatio-temporal predic-\\ntion plays a vital role in shaping smarter and more efficient cities,\\nultimately leading to an improved quality of urban life.\\nIt is important to highlight the various types of neural network\\narchitectures commonly adopted in this domain of spatio-temporal\\nprediction. These architectures are designed to capture and model\\nthe complex relationships between spatial and temporal dimensions\\nin the data. One widely employed architecture is the Convolutional\\nNeural Network (CNN) [ 15,39,45], which is effective in extract-\\ning spatial features by applying convolutional filters across the\\ninput data. Another line of spatio-temporal neural networks is the\\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) family [ 1,34,43]. Those spatio-\\ntemporal RNNs are well-suited for capturing temporal dependencies\\nby maintaining a memory state that can retain information over\\ntime. Recently, there has been a surge in the use of Graph Neural\\nNetworks (GNNs) for spatio-temporal prediction [ 36,40,47]. GNNs\\nexcel in modeling complex spatial relationships in data represented\\nas graphs, where each node corresponds to a spatial location and\\nedges capture the connections between them.\\nWhile current spatio-temporal neural network techniques have\\nproven to be highly effective, it is crucial to acknowledge their\\nstrong dependence on having an abundance of labeled data in order\\nto generate accurate predictions. However, the pervasive problem\\nof data scarcity in practical urban sensing scenarios poses a sig-\\nnificant challenge. For example, deploying sensors throughout the\\nentire urban space to monitor citywide traffic volume or air qual-\\nity is impractical due to the high cost involved [ 17,41]. Moreover,\\nthe challenge of limited labeled data availability extends to spatio-\\ntemporal forecasting across different cities, in which acquiring\\nlabeled data for each target city becomes a daunting task [ 13,38].\\nThese issues emphasize the pressing need for novel solutions that\\naddress data scarcity and enhance the generalization capabilities of\\nspatio-temporal models in various smart city applications.\\nInspired by the remarkable progress of large language models\\n(LLMs), our primary goal is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that\\npossesses outstanding generalization capabilities across a wide\\narray of urban tasks. Leveraging the reasoning abilities inherent in\\nLLMs, we aim to expand their success into the domain of spatio-\\ntemporal analysis. Our objective is to develop a model that can\\neffectively comprehend and forecast intricate spatial and temporal\\npatterns, enabling it to excel in various urban scenarios.\\nWhile it is of utmost importance to develop a versatile spatio-\\ntemporal model capable of effectively handling diverse downstreamarXiv:2403.00813v3  [cs.CL]  19 May 2024\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 2\\n\\nInstruction s:Given thehistorical data fortaxiflow over 12time steps inaspecific region ofNew York City, the\\nrecorded taxiinflows are[9194100 939376676650695542],and therecorded taxioutflows are[9691108\\n10283787674106938657]\u2026Please predict thetaxiinflow and outflow fornext 12time steps\u2026\\nLabel s:Taxi Inflow :[5536333033273714167512]Taxi Outflow :[547069593231292120111312].\\nOurs :Based onthegiven information, thepredictions oftaxiinflow and outflow inthisregion are\u2026\\nPrediction :Inflow :[514845424038332824211816]Outflow :[544945413835302521181614].\\nHuman\\nInstructions\\nLLAMA -70BGround true\\nPrediction :Inflow :[282827262524232323232424]Outflow :[343128252219171616151515] Baseline\\nLLM :There isanoticeable spike intaxiinflows and outflows around 10:00-11:00,which may indicate asurge in\\ndemand fortaxiservices\u2026Ihave created apredictive model toforecast thetaxiflow forthenext 12time steps :\\nPrediction :Inflow :[53586460677378849196102 108]Outflow :[5661687379848995102 107 113 119]\\nUrbanGPT\\n2 4 6 8 10 12\\nTime Steps020406080100 Inflow Predicted valueBaseline\\nLLM\\nOurs\\nGround_true\\n2 4 6 8 10 12\\nTime Steps020406080100120 Outflow Predicted valueBaseline\\nLLM\\nOurs\\nGround_trueFigure 1: The superior predictive performance of the pro-\\nposed UrbanGPT compared to the large language model\\n(LLaMA-70B) and the spatiotemporal graph neural network\\n(STGCN) in a zero-shot traffic flow prediction scenario.\\ntasks, aligning the spatio-temporal context with the knowledge\\nspace of large language models (LLMs) and enabling them to com-\\nprehend the complex dependencies across time and space present\\nsignificant challenges. These hurdles call for meticulous model\\ndesign to bridge the gap between the unique characteristics of\\nspatio-temporal data and the knowledge encoded within LLMs.\\nContributions . In light of these challenges, we propose UrbanGPT,\\na large language model specifically tailored for spatio-temporal\\nprediction. At the core of UrbanGPT lies a novel spatio-temporal\\ninstruction-tuning paradigm that seeks to align the intricate de-\\npendencies of time and space, with the knowledge space of LLMs.\\nWithin our UrbanGPT framework, we start by incorporating a\\nspatio-temporal dependency encoder, which utilizes a multi-level\\ntemporal convolutional network. This encoder enables the model\\nto capture the intricate temporal dynamics present in the spatio-\\ntemporal data across various time resolutions. Then, our model\\ninvolves aligning textual and spatio-temporal information to em-\\npower language models in effectively injecting spatio-temporal\\ncontextual signals. This is achieved through the utilization of a\\nlightweight alignment module that projects the representations\\nof spatio-temporal dependencies. The result is the generation of\\nmore expressive semantic representations by integrating valuable\\ninformation from both textual and spatio-temporal domains.\\nThrough the incorporation of spatio-temporal information dur-\\ning the instruction-tuning process, the language model gains profi-\\nciency in understanding and processing the intricate relationships\\nand patterns found in spatio-temporal data. By leveraging the in-\\nsights obtained from the spatio-temporal domain, the language\\nmodel becomes better equipped to capture the nuances and com-\\nplexities of spatio-temporal phenomena. This, in turn, enables the\\nmodel to make more reliable and insightful predictions across vari-\\nous urban scenarios, even when faced with limited data availability.\\nTo showcase the superior predictive performance of our pro-\\nposed model, we compare it with the large language model (LLaMA-\\n70B) and the spatio-temporal graph neural network (STGCN) in azero-shot traffic flow prediction scenario guided by textual instruc-\\ntions, as depicted in Figure 1. The large language model, LLaMA,\\neffectively infers traffic patterns from the input text. However, its\\nlimitations in handling numeric time-series data with complex spa-\\ntial and temporal dependencies can sometimes lead to opposite\\ntraffic trend predictions. On the other hand, the pre-trained base-\\nline model demonstrates a strong understanding of spatio-temporal\\ndependencies. However, it may suffer from overfitting to the source\\ndataset and underperform in zero-shot scenarios, indicating its lim-\\nited generalization capabilities beyond existing spatio-temporal\\nprediction models. In contrast, our proposed model achieves a har-\\nmonious integration of domain-specific spatio-temporal knowledge\\nand language modeling capabilities. This enables us to make more\\naccurate and reliable predictions under data scarcity.\\nIn summary, our main contributions can be outlined as follows:\\n\u2022To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop\\na spatio-temporal large language model capable of predicting\\ndiverse urban phenomena across different datasets, especially\\nunder conditions of limited data availability.\\n\u2022We propose UrbanGPT, a spatio-temporal prediction framework\\nthat empowers large language models (LLMs) to comprehend\\nthe intricate inter-dependencies across time and space. This is\\nachieved through the seamless integration of a spatio-temporal\\ndependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm, ef-\\nfectively aligning the spatio-temporal context with LLMs.\\n\u2022Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets\\nprovide compelling evidence of our proposed UrbanGPT\u2019s excep-\\ntional ability to generalize in zero-shot spatio-temporal learning\\nscenarios. These findings highlight the model\u2019s robust general-\\nization capacity, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately\\npredicting and understanding spatio-temporal patterns, even in\\nscenarios where no prior training data is available.\\n2 PRELIMINARIES\\nSpatio-Temporal Data . Spatio-temporal data is commonly col-\\nlected and can be represented as a three-dimensional tensor X\u2208\\nR\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc47\u00d7\ud835\udc39. Each element X\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udc53in the tensor corresponds to the value\\nof the\ud835\udc53-th feature at the \ud835\udc61-th time interval in the \ud835\udc5f-th region. To\\nprovide an example, let\u2019s consider predicting taxi traffic patterns in\\nan urban area. In this scenario, the data can represent the inflow\\nand outflow of taxis in a specific region ( e.g., the\ud835\udc5f-th spatial area)\\nduring a given time period from \ud835\udc61to\ud835\udc61\u22121(e.g., a 30-minute interval).\\nSpatio-Temporal Forecasting. In spatio-temporal prediction tasks,\\na common scenario involves forecasting future trends using histor-\\nical data. Specifically, the goal is to predict the data for the next \ud835\udc43\\ntime steps based on information from the preceding \ud835\udc3bsteps.\\nX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+\ud835\udc43=\ud835\udc53(X\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e\u2212\ud835\udc3b+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e) (1)\\nThe function \ud835\udc53(\u00b7)represents a spatio-temporal prediction model\\nthat has been trained effectively using historical data. Spatio-temporal\\nprediction tasks can be divided into two main categories: regression\\nprediction, which involves predicting continuous values like traffic\\nflow or taxi demand [ 22], and classification prediction, where the\\ngoal is to classify events such as crime occurrence prediction [ 11].\\nTo optimize the model \ud835\udc53(\u00b7), different loss functions are utilized\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 3\\n\\nbased on the specific characteristics of the spatio-temporal scenar-\\nios.\\nSpatio-Temporal Zero-Shot Learning . Despite the effectiveness\\nof current spatio-temporal learning approaches, they often en-\\ncounter difficulties in effectively generalizing across a wide range of\\ndownstream spatio-temporal learning scenarios. In this study, our\\nfocus is on addressing the challenge of spatio-temporal zero-shot\\nscenarios, where we aim to learn from previously unseen data in\\ndownstream spatio-temporal prediction datasets or tasks. This can\\nbe formally defined as follows:\\n\u02dcX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+\ud835\udc43=\u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u02dcX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e\u2212\ud835\udc3b+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e) (2)\\nIn this particular scenario, the prediction function \u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u00b7)is responsi-\\nble for forecasting the spatio-temporal data \u02dcXfrom downstream\\ntasks that have not been previously encountered. It should be noted\\nthat the model \u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u00b7)is not trained specifically on the target data.\\n3 METHODOLOGY\\n3.1 Spatio-Temporal Dependency Encoder\\nAlthough large language models demonstrate exceptional profi-\\nciency in language processing, they face challenges in comprehend-\\ning the time-evolving patterns inherent in spatio-temporal data. To\\novercome this limitation, we propose enhancing the capability of\\nlarge language models to capture temporal dependencies within\\nspatio-temporal contexts. This is accomplished by integrating a\\nspatio-temporal encoder that incorporates a multi-level tempo-\\nral convolutional network. By doing so, we enable the model to\\neffectively capture the intricate temporal dependencies across vari-\\nous time resolutions, thereby improving its understanding of the\\ncomplex temporal dynamics present in the spatio-temporal data.\\nSpecifically, our spatio-temporal encoder is composed of two key\\ncomponents: a gated dilated convolution layer and a multi-level\\ncorrelation injection layer. Let\u2019s formalize this architecture as:\\n\u03a8(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f=(\u00afW(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc58\u2217E(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+\u00afb(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc58)\u00b7\ud835\udeff(\u00afW(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc54\u2217E(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+\u00afb(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc54)+E\u2032(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f (3)\\nWe begin with the initial spatio-temporal embedding, denoted as\\nE\ud835\udc5f\u2208R\ud835\udc47\u00d7\ud835\udc51. This embedding is obtained by enhancing the original\\ndata Xthrough a linear layer. To address the issue of gradient\\nvanishing, we utilize a slice of E\ud835\udc5f, denoted as E\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5f\u2208R\ud835\udc47\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51, which\\nis determined by the size of the dilated convolutional kernel. This\\nslice is employed for performing residual operations. To perform\\nthe residual operations, we use 1-D dilated convolution kernels\\n\u00afW\ud835\udc58and \u00afW\ud835\udc54\u2208R\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc54\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61, along with the corresponding bias\\nterms \u00afb\ud835\udc58and \u00afb\ud835\udc54\u2208R\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61. The sigmoid activation function \ud835\udeffis\\napplied to control the degree of information preservation during the\\nrepeated convolution operation. After the gated temporal dilated\\nconvolutional layer encoding, we are able to effectively capture the\\ntemporal dependencies across multiple time steps, resulting in the\\ngeneration of temporal representations.\\nThese representations contain different levels of temporal de-\\npendencies, reflecting various granularity-aware time-evolving pat-\\nterns. To preserve these informative patterns, we introduce a multi-\\nlevel correlation injection layer. This layer is designed to incorpo-\\nrate correlations between different levels and is formalized as:\\nS(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f=(W(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc60\u2217\u03a8(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+b(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc60)+S(\ud835\udc59\u22121)\\n\ud835\udc5f (4)We have the convolution kernel W\ud835\udc60\u2208R\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc46\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\u00d7\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61and the bias\\nvector b\ud835\udc60\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61. These are employed after \ud835\udc3flayers of encoding.\\nA simple non-linear layer is employed to merge the results from\\nequations 3 and 4, and the final spatio-temporal dependency repre-\\nsentations of are denoted as \u02dc\u03a8\u2208R\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc39\u00d7\ud835\udc51. To address the diverse\\nset of urban scenarios that may arise downstream, our proposed\\nspatio-temporal encoder is designed to be independent of graph\\nstructures when modeling spatial correlations. This is particularly\\ncrucial because in zero-shot prediction contexts, the spatial rela-\\ntionships between entities may be unknown or difficult to ascertain.\\nBy not relying on explicit graph structures, our encoder can effec-\\ntively handle a broad spectrum of urban scenarios, where spatial\\ncorrelations and dependencies can vary or be challenging to define\\nin advance. This flexibility enables our model to adapt and perform\\nwell, ensuring its applicability in a wide range of urban contexts.\\n3.2 Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning\\n3.2.1 Spatio-Temporal-Text Alignment. In order to enable lan-\\nguage models to effectively comprehend spatio-temporal patterns,\\nit is crucial to align textual and spatio-temporal information. This\\nalignment allows for the fusion of different modalities, resulting\\nin a more informative representation. By integrating contextual\\nfeatures from both textual and spatio-temporal domains, we can\\ncapture complementary information and extract higher-level se-\\nmantic representations that are more expressive and meaningful.\\nTo achieve this objective, we utilize a lightweight alignment mod-\\nule to project the spatio-temporal dependencies representations\\n\u02dc\u03a8. This projection involves the use of parameters W\ud835\udc5d\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f\\nandb\ud835\udc5d\u2208R\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, where\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3frepresents the commonly used hidden\\ndimension in language models (LLMs).\\nThe resulting projection, denoted as H\u2208R\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc39\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, are rep-\\nresented in the instructions using special tokens as: <ST_start>,\\n<ST_HIS>, ..., <ST_HIS>, <ST_end>. Here, <ST_start> and <ST_end>\\nserve as identifiers marking the beginning and end of the spatio-\\ntemporal token. These identifiers can be included in the large-\\nscale language model by expanding its vocabulary. The placeholder\\n<ST_HIS> represents the spatio-temporal token and corresponds to\\nthe projection Hin the hidden layer. By employing this technique,\\nthe model gains the ability to discern spatio-temporal dependen-\\ncies, thereby enhancing its proficiency in successfully performing\\nspatio-temporal predictive tasks within urban scenes.\\n3.2.2 Spatio-Temporal Prompt Instructions. In scenarios in-\\nvolving spatio-temporal prediction, both temporal and spatial in-\\nformation contain valuable semantic details that contribute to the\\nmodel\u2019s understanding of spatio-temporal patterns within specific\\ncontexts. For instance, traffic flow in the early morning differs sig-\\nnificantly from rush hour, and there are variations in traffic patterns\\nbetween commercial and residential areas. As a result, we recognize\\nthe potential of representing both temporal and spatial information\\nas prompt instruction text. We leverage the text understanding\\ncapabilities of large language models to encode this information,\\nenabling associative reasoning for downstream tasks.\\nIn our UrbanGPT framework, we integrate multi-granularity\\ntime information and spatial details as instruction inputs for the\\nlarge language model. Time information includes factors such as\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 4\\n\\nl = 1l = 2l = 3\\nGateSpatio -Temporal dependenc yencoder\\nLLMs spaceLightweight alignment moduleSpatio -Temporal Instruction -Tuning\\nGiven the historical data and the corresponding tokens\\n<ST_HIS> fortaxi flow \u2026The recording time \u2026This region\\nislocated \u2026Please generate thepredictive tokens for\u2026\\nBased onthe given information, the predictive tokens\\noftaxi inflow and outflow inthis region are<ST_PRE> \u2026\\nLarge Language Models\\nInflow\uff1a[28 26 20 33 49  50 48 34 40 22 \u2026]\\nOutflow\uff1a[40 52 58 32 22 10 18 19 20 24\u2026]City A\\nCity B\\n\u2026\\nInstruction -Tuning Zero -shot prediction\\n<ST_HIS> <ST_HIS> Multi -tasks\\nRegression Layer<ST_HIS> <ST_ PRE> \\ntokens\\nText Replacement\\nLlama VicunaAlignment\\nRegressionST Encoder\\nTask assignment\\nText instructionsInstructions\\nResponsesRegion A\\nRegion B\\nFrozen Trainable\\n\u2026\\nSpatio -Temporal Zero -shot prediction\\nTrain city\\nTest cityTrain region\\nTest region\\nST dependency representations ST Instruction -Tuning of LLMsFigure 2: The overall architecture of the proposed spatio-temporal language model UrbanGPT.\\nTemporal Information :The recording time ofthehistorical data is'January 7,2020 ,08:30,\\nTuesday toJanuary 7,2020 ,14:00,Tuesday, with data points recorded at30-minute intervals' .\\nSpatial Information :Here istheregion information :This region islocated within theStaten\\nIsland borough district and encompasses various POIs within athree -kilometer radius,\\ncovering Public Safety, Education Facility, Residential categories .\\nTask description :Now wewant topredict thetaxi inflow and outflow forthenext 12time\\nsteps during thetime period of'January 7,2020 ,14:30,Tuesday toJanuary 7,2020 ,20:00,\\nTuesday, with data points recorded at30-minute intervals' .\\nFigure 3: Illustration of spatio-temporal prompt instructions\\nencoding the time- and location-aware information.\\nthe day of the week and the hour of the day, while regional in-\\nformation encompasses the city, administrative areas, and nearby\\npoints of interest (POI) data, among others. By incorporating these\\ndiverse elements, UrbanGPT is capable of identifying and assimi-\\nlating spatio-temporal patterns across different regions and time-\\nframes. This enables the model to encapsulate these insights within\\ncomplex spatio-temporal contexts, thereby enhancing its ability\\nfor zero-shot reasoning. The design of the instructional text for\\nspatio-temporal information is illustrated in Figure 3.\\n3.2.3 Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning of LLMs. When\\nit comes to incorporating detailed spatio-temporal textual descrip-\\ntions, the next stage is to fine-tune large language models (LLMs)\\nusing instructions to generate spatio-temporal forecasts in textual\\nformat. However, this approach poses two challenges. Firstly , spatio-\\ntemporal forecasting typically relies on numerical data, which dif-\\nfers in structure and patterns from natural language that language\\nmodels excel at processing, focusing on semantic and syntactic rela-\\ntionships. Secondly , large language models are typically pre-trained\\nusing a multi-classification loss to predict vocabulary, resulting in a\\nprobability distribution of potential outcomes. This contrasts with\\nthe continuous value distribution required for regression tasks.\\nTo address these challenges, UrbanGPT adopts a different strat-\\negy by refraining from directly predicting future spatio-temporal\\nvalues. Instead, it generates forecasting tokens that aid in the pre-\\ndiction process. These tokens are subsequently passed through a\\nregression layer, which maps the hidden representations to generate\\nmore accurate predictive values. The formulation of the regressionlayer in our spatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm is:\\n\u02c6Y\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53=W3[\ud835\udf0e(W1H\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53),\ud835\udf0e(W2\u0393\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53)] (5)\\nThe prediction result, denoted as \u02c6Y\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53\u2208R\ud835\udc43, is obtained using the\\nrectified linear unit activation function, represented by \ud835\udf0e. The hid-\\nden representations of the forecasting tokens, denoted as \u0393\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53\u2208\\nR\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, are introduced as a novel term in the vocabulary of large lan-\\nguage models (LLMs). The regression layer is formulated using\\nweight matrices W1\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f,W2\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, and W3\u2208R\ud835\udc43\u00d72\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n,\\nwhere[\u00b7,\u00b7]represents the concatenation operation. While the prob-\\nability distribution of the forecasting tokens remains relatively\\nstable, their hidden representations contain rich spatio-temporal\\ncontextual attributes that capture dynamic spatio-temporal interde-\\npendencies. This enables our model to provide precise predictions\\nby leveraging this contextual information.\\n3.3 Model Optimization\\nBuilding upon the baseline model [ 1,8], we adopt the absolute error\\nloss as our regression loss function. This choice allows us to effec-\\ntively handle predictions across a wide range of urban scenarios.\\nAdditionally, we introduce a classification loss as a joint loss to\\ncater to diverse task requirements. To ensure optimal performance,\\nour model optimizes different losses based on the specific task in-\\nputs. For instance, we utilize the regression loss for tasks such as\\ntraffic flow prediction, while employing the classification loss for\\ntasks like crime prediction. This approach enables our model to\\neffectively address the unique challenges posed by each task and\\ndeliver accurate predictions in various urban scenarios.\\nL\ud835\udc50=\u22121\\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01\\n\ud835\udc56=1[\ud835\udeff(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)\u00b7log(\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)+(1\u2212\ud835\udeff(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56))\u00b7log(1\u2212\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)]\\nL\ud835\udc5f=1\\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01\\n\ud835\udc56=1|\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\u2212\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56|;L=L\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc60+L\ud835\udc5f+L\ud835\udc50 (6)\\nHere,\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56represents a sample from \u02c6Y, and\ud835\udc41represents the total\\nnumber of samples, which is calculated as the product of \ud835\udc45,\ud835\udc47, and\\n\ud835\udc39. We use various loss functions in our model, including L\ud835\udc50for\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 5\\n\\nbinary cross-entropy loss, L\ud835\udc5ffor regression loss, and the cross-\\nentropy loss adopted in our spatio-temporal language models. To\\ncapture probability distributions from the prediction, we employ\\nthe sigmoid function denoted by \ud835\udeff. Each of these loss functions\\nplays a specific role in our model, allowing us to effectively handle\\nclassification, regression, and language modeling tasks as needed.\\n4 EVALUATION\\nIn this section, we aim to assess the capabilities of our proposed\\nmodel across various settings by addressing five key questions:\\n\u2022RQ1 : What is the performance and generalization capability of\\nUrbanGPT in diverse zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction tasks?\\n\u2022RQ2 : How does UrbanGPT perform when compared to existing\\nspatio-temporal models in classical supervised scenarios?\\n\u2022RQ3 : What specific contributions do the proposed key compo-\\nnents bring to enhance the capabilities of our UrbanGPT model?\\n\u2022RQ4 : Can the proposed model robustly handle the forecasting\\nscenarios with varying spatio-temporal patterns?\\n4.1 Experimental Setting\\n4.1.1 Dataset Description. To evaluate the effectiveness of the\\nproposed model in predicting spatio-temporal patterns across var-\\nious urban computing scenarios, we conducted experiments us-\\ning four distinct datasets: NYC-taxi, NYC-bike, NYC-crime, and\\nCHI-taxi. These datasets encompass a wide range of data sources\\nto capture the dynamic nature of urban environments, including\\nrecords of taxi travel, bike trajectories, crime incidents in New York\\nCity, and taxi travel data in Chicago. To facilitate our analysis, we\\npartitioned the cities into grid-like regions based on latitude and\\nlongitude information. Within specific time intervals, we aggre-\\ngated statistical measures for each region. For example, this in-\\nvolved calculating the number of taxi inflows and outflows within\\na 30-minute period in region A, or determining the count of theft\\nincidents within a day in region B. Furthermore, Points of Interest\\n(POIs) data can be obtained through APIs provided by map services,\\nutilizing the latitude and longitude of different regions. For more\\ncomprehensive data descriptions, please refer to the Appendix.\\n4.1.2 Evaluation Protocols. In order to investigate the capabili-\\nties of large language models in analyzing diverse spatio-temporal\\ndata across different regions, we selected a subset of taxi, bike, and\\ncrime data from various areas of New York City as our training set.\\n\u2022Zero-Shot Learning Scenarios . We assessed the model perfor-\\nmance by predicting future spatio-temporal data from regions in\\nNYC or even Chicago that were unseen in the training phase.\\n\u2022Supervised Learning Scenarios . We evaluated the model using\\nfuture data from the same regions as the training set.\\nFor regression tasks, we maintained a consistent training and test-\\ning methodology across all baseline models. When it came to classi-\\nfication tasks involving crime data, we utilized binary cross-entropy\\nas the loss function for training and testing the models. Our ex-\\nperiments were conducted using the robust vicuna-7b [ 50] as the\\nfoundational large language model for UrbanGPT. For a more com-\\nprehensive understanding of our methodology and experimental\\nsetup, please refer to the appendix for detailed information.4.1.3 Evaluation Metrics. For regression tasks, we employed\\nMAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)\\nas evaluation metrics. These metrics quantify the discrepancies\\nbetween the predicted outcomes and the actual labels, with lower\\nvalues indicating superior performance [ 12,49]. In the case of clas-\\nsification tasks, we utilized Recall and Macro-F1 as evaluation met-\\nrics to assess performance. Recall measures the model\u2019s ability to\\ncorrectly identify positive instances, while Macro-F1 is a compre-\\nhensive performance metric that combines precision and recall to\\nprovide an overall measure of classification accuracy [11, 30].\\n4.1.4 Baseline Model. We conducted a thorough comparison\\nwith 10 advanced models to establish baselines for our proposed\\nmethod. (i)In the category of RNNs-based spatio-temporal forecast-\\ning methods, we compared our proposed method with AGCRN [ 1],\\nDMVSTNET [ 39] and ST-LSTM [ 33]. These approaches leverage\\nRNNs for modeling and prediction. (ii)The GNNs-based spatio-\\ntemporal models primarily utilize graph neural networks to cap-\\nture spatial correlations and integrate temporal encoders to capture\\nspatio-temporal relationships. The models we compared against\\nin this category include GWN [ 37], MTGNN [ 36], STSGCN [ 26],\\nTGCN [ 47], and STGCN [ 42].(iii) In the attention-based spatio-\\ntemporal models category, the methods employ attention mecha-\\nnisms to model spatio-temporal correlations. The models we com-\\npared against in this category are ASTGCN [8] and STWA [5].\\n4.2 Zero-Shot Prediction Performance (RQ1)\\nIn this section, we thoroughly evaluate the predictive performance\\nof our proposed model in zero-shot scenarios. The results of our\\nevaluation are presented in Table 1 and visualized in Figure 4. Our\\nobjective is to assess the model\u2019s effectiveness in predicting spatio-\\ntemporal patterns in geographical areas that it has not encountered\\nduring training. This evaluation encompasses both cross-region\\nand cross-city settings, allowing us to gain insights into the model\u2019s\\ngeneralization capabilities across different locations.\\n4.2.1 Prediction on Unseen Regions within a City. Cross-\\nregion scenarios entail using data from certain regions within a\\ncity to forecast future conditions in other regions that have not\\nbeen encountered by the model. Through a thorough analysis of\\nthe model\u2019s performance in these cross-region predictions, we can\\ndraw attention to three significant observations:\\ni) Superior Zero-shot Predictive Performance . The results pre-\\nsented in Table 1 highlight the exceptional performance of our\\nproposed model in both regression and classification tasks on vari-\\nous datasets, surpassing the baseline models in zero-shot prediction.\\nThe success of our model can be attributed to two key factors.\\n\u2022Spatio-Temporal-Text-Alignment . The alignment of spatio-\\ntemporal contextual signals with the text comprehension abil-\\nities of language models plays a pivotal role in the success of\\nour proposed model. This fusion enables the model to effectively\\ncapitalize on both the encoded urban dynamics from the spa-\\ntiotemporal signals and the comprehensive understanding of\\ntextual context provided by the LLMs. By leveraging these two\\nessential aspects, our model achieves the remarkable ability to\\ngeneralize its prediction capabilities in zero-shot scenarios.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 6\\n\\nTable 1: Our model\u2019s performance in zero-shot prediction is evaluated on three diverse datasets: NYC-taxi, NYC-bike, and\\nNYC-crime, providing a comprehensive assessment of its predictive capabilities in unseen situations.\\nModelDataset NYC-taxi NYC-bike NYC-crime\\nType Inflow Outflow Inflow Outflow Burglary Robbery\\nMetrics MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE Macro-F1 Recall Macro-F1 Recall\\nAGCRN 10.86 26.51 13.15 36.45 3.41 7.98 3.42 8.08 0.48 0.00 0.49 0.01\\nASTGCN 9.75 24.12 12.42 33.28 5.58 11.58 5.78 12.29 0.49 0.01 0.55 0.09\\nGWN 10.73 26.50 9.67 26.74 3.32 8.17 3.07 7.52 0.48 0.00 0.52 0.04\\nMTGNN 10.16 25.84 12.59 35.38 3.18 7.62 3.20 7.65 0.64 0.27 0.65 0.30\\nSTWA 11.28 28.97 13.54 38.61 4.59 10.94 4.35 10.67 0.48 0.00 0.51 0.03\\nSTSGCN 18.97 41.38 20.07 45.79 6.85 14.98 6.54 14.77 0.48 0.00 0.48 0.00\\nSTGCN 12.54 30.80 14.32 39.58 4.11 9.21 4.45 9.62 0.48 0.00 0.64 0.30\\nTGCN 10.04 25.10 10.98 30.03 2.88 6.55 2.91 6.42 0.56 0.10 0.58 0.13\\nDMVSTNET 11.00 28.29 10.59 29.20 3.80 9.87 3.65 9.21 0.48 0.01 0.59 0.15\\nST-LSTM 16.97 34.43 18.93 44.10 7.78 15.41 6.92 17.12 0.48 0.00 0.49 0.03\\nUrbanGPT 6.16 16.92 6.83 21.78 2.02 5.16 2.01 5.03 0.67 0.34 0.69 0.42\\n\u2022Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning . This adaptive tuning\\nprocess empowers the LLM to effectively integrate crucial in-\\nformation from the instructions, enhancing its comprehension\\nof the complex relationships and dependencies between spatial\\nand temporal factors. By seamlessly merging the spatio-temporal\\ninstruction-tuning with the spatio-temporal dependency encoder,\\nour proposed model, UrbanGPT, successfully preserves universal\\nand transferable spatio-temporal knowledge. Consequently, the\\nmodel becomes capable of capturing the fundamental patterns\\nand dynamics that govern spatio-temporal phenomena, enabling\\nit to make precise predictions in downstream zero-shot scenarios.\\nii) Enhanced Urban Semantic Understanding . Urban seman-\\ntics offer valuable insights into the diverse dimensions of spatial\\nand temporal characteristics. Our approach involves training our\\nmodel on a wide range of datasets, enriching its understanding\\nof spatio-temporal dynamics across different timeframes and geo-\\ngraphical locations. In contrast, baseline models tend to prioritize\\nencoding temporal and spatial dependencies, neglecting the nu-\\nanced semantics that differentiate regions, timeframes, and data\\ncategories. By incorporating comprehensive semantic awareness\\ninto our UrbanGPT, we significantly enhance its ability to make\\naccurate zero-shot predictions in previously unseen regions.\\niii) Improved Performance in Sparse Data Scenarios . Predict-\\ning spatio-temporal patterns in sparse data environments is chal-\\nlenging as models tend to overfit when data points are scarce. This\\nchallenge is particularly notable when predicting crimes, where data\\nis often sparse but crucial for accurate predictions. Baseline mod-\\nels struggle in cross-regional prediction tasks under these sparse\\nconditions, resulting in low recall scores that indicate potential over-\\nfitting. To overcome this limitation, our model integrates spatio-\\ntemporal learning with large language models (LLMs) using an\\neffective spatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm. By incorpo-\\nrating rich semantic insights, our approach enhances the model\u2019s\\nspatio-temporal representations, enabling it to effectively handle\\nsparse data and achieve improved prediction accuracy.\\n4.2.2 Cross-City Prediction Task. To assess the performance of\\nour model in cross-city prediction tasks, we conducted tests on the\\nCHI-taxi dataset, which was not seen during the training phase. The\\nresults, depicted in Figure 4, yielded the following observations:\u2022Consistency in Multi-step Prediction : Our model consistently\\noutperforms the comparison method at each time step. Notably,\\nit maintains a significant advantage in both short-term and long-\\nterm spatio-temporal prediction, demonstrating the robustness\\nof our proposed model in cross-city prediction scenarios.\\n\u2022Effective Knowledge Transfer Across Cities : The prediction\\nresults obtained from the CHI-taxi dataset validate the supe-\\nrior forecasting capabilities of our model in cross-city scenarios.\\nThis enhancement can be attributed to the integration of spatio-\\ntemporal encoders with the spatio-temporal instruction-tuning\\nparadigm. By incorporating these components, our model ef-\\nfectively captures universal and transferable spatio-temporal\\npatterns, allowing it to make accurate predictions. Additionally,\\nby considering different geographical information and temporal\\nfactors alongside the learned transferred knowledge, our model\\nsuccessfully associates spatio-temporal patterns exhibited by\\nsimilar functional areas and historical periods. This comprehen-\\nsive understanding provides valuable insights for making precise\\nzero-shot predictions in cross-city scenarios.\\n4.3 Classical Supervised Prediction Task (RQ2)\\nThis section examines the predictive capabilities of our UrbanGPT\\nin end-to-end supervised prediction scenarios, as presented in Ta-\\nble 2. We will discuss the results from two perspectives below.\\nEnhanced Long-Term Forecasting Abilities : We examined the\\nmodel\u2019s effectiveness in long-term spatio-temporal forecasting by\\nutilizing test datasets that spanned broader time intervals. For in-\\nstance, we trained the model using data from 2017 and evaluated its\\nperformance on data from 2021. The results of these experiments\\ndemonstrate that our UrbanGPT possesses a significant advantage\\nover the baselines, highlighting its superior ability to generalize\\nacross different temporal landscapes. This capability reduces the\\nneed for frequent retraining or incremental updates, making the\\nmodel more aligned with real-world applications. Additionally, the\\nexperiments have confirmed that incorporating additional textual\\nknowledge does not hinder model performance or introduce noise,\\nthus further validating the feasibility of utilizing large language\\nmodels to enhance spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.\\nSpatial Semantic Understanding : Accurately capturing spatial\\ncorrelations is crucial in the realm of spatio-temporal prediction.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 7\\n\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon23456 MAE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOurs\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon3456789101112131415 RMSE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOurs\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon12345 MAE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOurs\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon456789101112131415 RMSE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOursFigure 4: Time step-based prediction comparison experiment conducted on the CHI-taxi dataset.\\nTable 2: Evaluation of performance in the end-to-end super-\\nvised setting on the NYC-taxi and NYC-bike datasets.\\nModelNYC-taxi NYC-bike\\nInflow Outflow Inflow Outflow\\nMAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE\\nAGCRN 2.83 8.35 2.62 9.21 3.30 7.65 3.38 7.73\\nASTGCN 5.41 18.04 5.00 19.29 3.87 7.93 3.66 7.69\\nGWN 3.91 11.93 2.89 10.85 4.30 9.04 3.88 8.29\\nMTGNN 3.09 10.13 2.61 10.96 3.31 7.47 3.26 7.61\\nSTWA 3.90 12.64 3.15 11.32 4.23 9.07 4.18 9.18\\nSTSGCN 4.57 13.93 4.41 15.87 5.10 12.23 4.72 10.78\\nSTGCN 3.45 9.82 3.17 10.53 3.88 9.23 3.90 9.08\\nTGCN 3.99 11.47 3.31 11.58 4.12 7.92 4.11 7.84\\nDMVSTNET 3.83 11.55 2.76 9.88 3.71 7.95 3.69 7.92\\nST-LSTM 7.78 15.41 6.92 17.12 5.00 11.52 4.96 11.41\\nUrbanGPT 2.50 6.78 1.71 6.68 3.11 7.10 3.01 6.94\\nTraditional methods often employ graph networks or attention\\nmechanisms to analyze these correlations. Models lacking dedi-\\ncated spatial correlation modules, like LSTM, tend to underperform\\nas they overlook the spatial context. In contrast, our model com-\\npensates for the absence of explicit spatial encoders by integrating\\nextensive geographic and points of interest (POIs) data within the\\ntextual input. This approach enables the model to comprehend the\\nshared characteristics of areas with similar functions at a higher\\nsemantic level. Consequently, it deduces patterns of correlation\\nbetween various functional zones and effectively represents the\\ninterconnections among different regions.\\n4.4 Ablation study (RQ3)\\nThis section investigates the impact of different key components\\non the performance of our model, as illustrated in Figure 5. Our\\nrigorous testing primarily revolves around the zero-shot scenario\\nusing the NYC-taxi dataset. Through our analysis, we have distilled\\nthe benefits offered by the different modules into four key points.\\n\u2022(1) Impact of Spatial and Temporal Context :-STC . By re-\\nmoving time and spatial information from the instruction text,\\nwe observed a noticeable decline in the model\u2019s performance.\\nThis can be attributed to the lack of temporal information, forcing\\nthe model to rely solely on spatio-temporal encoders for encoding\\ntime-related features and performing prediction tasks. Furthermore,\\nthe absence of spatial information hindered the model\u2019s ability to\\ncapture spatial correlations, making it challenging to analyze the\\ndistinct spatio-temporal patterns of different areas.\\n\u2022(2) Impact of Instruction-Tuning with Diverse Datasets :-\\nMulti . We conducted our training solely on the NYC-taxi data to\\nexamine whether incorporating multiple datasets would provide\\nvaluable insights to the LLMs in zero-shot scenarios.\\n-STC -Multi -STE Ours -T2P\\nNYC-taxi inflow6.06.26.46.66.87.0 MAE\\nNYC-taxi inflow16.817.217.618.0 RMSE\\nNYC-taxi outflow6.66.87.07.27.47.67.88.0 MAE\\nNYC-taxi outflow21.522.022.523.023.524.024.5 RMSEFigure 5: Ablation study of our proposed UrbanGPT.\\nHowever, this restricted training approach limited the model\u2019s\\nability to fully uncover the spatio-temporal dynamics of cities due to\\nthe absence of diverse urban indicators. As a result, the model\u2019s per-\\nformance was suboptimal. By integrating diverse spatio-temporal\\ndata from multiple sources, our model can effectively capture the\\nunique characteristics of different geographical locations and their\\nevolving spatio-temporal patterns.\\n\u2022(3) Impact of Spatio-Temporal Encoder :-STE . In this vari-\\nant, we disable the spatio-temporal encoder to investigate its\\neffect on aligning the large language model with encoded urban\\ndependency dynamics into latent embedding space.\\nThe results clearly indicate that the absence of the spatio-temporal\\nencoder significantly hampers the performance of the large lan-\\nguage model in spatio-temporal prediction scenarios. This under-\\nscores the crucial role played by the proposed spatio-temporal\\nencoder in enhancing the model\u2019s predictive capabilities.\\n\u2022(4) Regression Layer Incorporation in Instruction-Tuning:\\nT2P. We explicitly instructed UrbanGPT to generate its predic-\\ntions in a textual format. However, the suboptimal performance\\nindicates the challenges in utilizing LLMs for precise numerical\\nregression tasks, as opposed to employing regression layers.\\nThe primary challenge stems from the model\u2019s dependence on\\nmulti-class loss for optimization during training, leading to a mis-\\nmatch between the model\u2019s probabilistic output and the continuous\\nvalue distribution necessary for spatio-temporal forecasting. To\\nbridge this gap, we incorporated a regression predictor into our\\nmodel, significantly improving its capacity to generate more precise\\nnumerical predictions for regression tasks.\\n4.5 Model Robustness Study (RQ4)\\nIn this section, we focus on evaluating the robustness of our Ur-\\nbanGPT across different spatio-temporal pattern scenarios. We cate-\\ngorize regions based on the magnitude of numerical variations, such\\nas taxi flow, during a specific time period. Lower variance indicates\\nstable temporal patterns, while higher variance suggests diverse\\nspatio-temporal patterns in active commercial zones or densely\\npopulated areas.

However, the baseline model struggles in\\nregions with high variance, particularly within the (0.75, 1.0] range,\\nresulting in inaccurate predictions. This limitation may stem from\\nthe baseline model\u2019s difficulty in inferring spatio-temporal patterns\\nin unseen regions during zero-shot scenarios. In practical applica-\\ntions, accurate prediction of densely populated or bustling areas\\nis crucial for urban governance, such as traffic light control and\\nsecurity scheduling.

We em-\\nphasize the challenges these models face in directly understanding\\nspatio-temporal patterns from numeric geo-series data. In con-\\ntrast, we showcase the exceptional performance of our proposed\\nUrbanGPT framework in capturing universal spatio-temporal pat-\\nterns and its ability to generalize effectively across various zero-shot\\nspatio-temporal forecasting scenarios. For a more comprehensive\\nunderstanding, please refer to the Appendix.\\n5 RELATED WORK\\nDeep Spatio-temporal Prediction Models . Deep spatio-temporal\\nprediction methods have gained prominence in deep learning due\\nto their impressive performance. These models typically consist of\\ntwo components: temporal dependency modeling and spatial corre-\\nlation encoding. Early models like D-LSTM [ 43] and ST-resnet [ 45]\\nused RNNs and convolutional networks to model temporal and\\nspatial dependencies. Graph neural networks (GNNs) proved to\\nbe a natural fit for spatial correlation modeling, as seen in models\\nlike STGCN [ 42] and DCRNN [ 14], which utilized graph structures\\nbased on node distances. Techniques such as learnable region-wise\\ngraph structures [ 36,37] and dynamic spatio-temporal graph net-\\nworks [9, 48] have further enhanced spatial correlation modeling.\\nFurthermore, researchers have explored approaches such as\\nmulti-scale temporal learning [ 34] and multi-granularity tempo-\\nral learning [ 8] to encode temporal dependencies. These strategies\\nenable the capture of features like long-term and short-term correla-\\ntions as well as periodicity. These advancements have significantlycontributed to the progress of spatio-temporal prediction. However,\\nit is worth noting that the majority of these studies are tailored\\nfor supervised contexts, with limited research and development\\nfocused on zero-shot spatio-temporal forecasting. This represents\\nan important area that requires further exploration.\\nSpatio-Temporal Pre-training . Spatio-temporal pre-training tech-\\nniques have recently received significant research attention. These\\ntechniques primarily focus on generative [ 16,24] and contrastive [ 46]\\npre-training models to enhance the predictive performance of down-\\nstream tasks. There has also been extensive exploration of pretrain-\\nfinetune frameworks for few-shot learning scenarios [ 13,19], aim-\\ning to improve knowledge transferability by aligning source and\\ntarget data. However, these approaches require training or fine-\\ntuning on target data and lack zero-shot prediction capabilities. In\\nthis work, we address the challenge of data scarcity in downstream\\nurban scenarios by proposing UrbanGPT. Our model demonstrates\\nthe ability to generalize well across various scenarios, mitigating\\nthe need for extensive training or fine-tuning on target data.\\nLarge Language Models. The emergence of large language mod-\\nels [3,21] has recently attracted significant attention due to their\\nunprecedented machine performance in tasks like text understand-\\ning and reasoning. These models have become a hot topic, demon-\\nstrating the potential to advance from intelligent algorithms to\\nartificial intelligence. Open-source large language models such as\\nLlama [ 28,29], Vicuna [ 50], and ChatGLM [ 44] have been released,\\nleading to researchers exploring their application in various fields\\nto enhance transfer learning capabilities with domain knowledge\\nfrom these models. In the computer vision domain, researchers\\nhave combined multimodal large language models with prompt\\nlearning methods to achieve zero-shot predictions in downstream\\ntasks [ 25,51,52]. Furthermore, the capabilities of LLMs in graph\\nreasoning [ 2,4,27], recommendation [ 10,23,35] and traffic anal-\\nysis [ 6] have been extensively studied. However, the utilization\\nof large language models for zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction\\ntasks in the field of urban intelligence remains largely unexplored.\\n6 CONCLUSION\\nWe present the UrbanGPT, a spatio-temporal large language model,\\nto generalize well in diverse urban scenarios. To seamlessly align\\nthe spatio-temporal contextual signals with LLMs, we introduce a\\nspatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm. This empowers the\\nUrbanGPT with the remarkable ability to learn universal and trans-\\nferable spatio-temporal patterns across various types of urban data.\\nThrough extensive experiments and meticulous ablation studies,\\nwe demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of the UrbanGPT\u2019s\\narchitecture and its key components. However, it is important to\\nacknowledge that while the results are promising, there are still\\nlimitations to be addressed in future studies. As a first step, we are\\nactively engaged in collecting a more diverse range of urban data\\nto enhance and refine the capabilities of our UrbanGPT across a\\nbroader spectrum of urban computing domains. Additionally, un-\\nderstanding the decision-making process of our UrbanGPT is of im-\\nportance. While the model demonstrates exceptional performance,\\nproviding interpretability and explainability is equally essential.\\nFuture research efforts will focus on empowering our model with\\nthe ability to interpret and explain its predictions.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 9\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n[1]Lei Bai, Lina Yao, Can Li, Xianzhi Wang, and Can Wang. 2020.

We collected data on taxi flows, bicycle\\nflows, and crime incidents in New York City for training and evalu-\\nation. The NYC-taxi dataset contains 263 regions, with each region\\nmeasuring approximately 3km x 3km. The time sampling inter-\\nval for this dataset is 30 minutes. The NYC-bike and NYC-crime\\ndatasets consist of 2162 regions, each represented by a 1km x 1km\\ngrid. The time sampling interval for NYC-bike is also 30 minutes,\\nwhile for NYC-crime, it is 1 day. All datasets cover the time period\\nfrom Jan 1, 2016, to Dec 31, 2021, in NYC. The CHI-taxi dataset\\nincludes 77 regions, with each region measuring approximately\\n4km x 4km. This dataset includes all taxi data from January 1, 2021,\\nto December 31, 2021, with a time sampling interval of 30 minutes.\\nA.1.2 Hyperparameters Settings. The parameters for the di-\\nlation convolution kernel in the time encoder are set as follows:\\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b,\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61, and\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61are all set to 32, with a dilation factor of 1. For\\nour prediction task, we aim to predict the next 12 steps of data\\nbased on the previous 12 steps. Both the history length ( \ud835\udc3b) and\\nprediction length ( \ud835\udc43) are set to 12. The projection layer parameters\\nare configured with \ud835\udc51set to 64 and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3fset to 4096. Lastly, the hidden\\nlayer parameter \ud835\udc51\u2032for the regression layer is set to 128.\\nA.1.3 Further Experimental Setup Descriptions. During the\\ninstruction-tuning phase, we randomly selected 80 regions from\\nthe three datasets in New York City as training data. It\u2019s important\\nto note that the region indices were kept consistent for the NYC-\\nbike and NYC-crime datasets. The training sets had specific time\\nintervals: for NYC-taxi datasets, it ranged from January 1, 2017,\\nto March 31, 2017; for NYC-bike datasets, it covered April 1, 2017,\\nto June 30, 2017; and for NYC-crime datasets, it spanned from\\nJanuary 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018. For the pretraining of the\\nspatio-temporal dependency encoder and the baseline models, we\\nutilized the same data for training to optimize the parameters. The\\nmaximum epoch count was set at 100. In the testing phase, we\\nconducted the following evaluations:\\n\u2022(i)Zero-Shot Prediction . We also selected an additional 80\\nregions from the New York City datasets as unseen test data. For\\nthe NYC-bike and NYC-taxi datasets, we used the first two weeks\\nof data in 2020 for testing. As for the NYC-crime dataset, we used\\nthe entire year of 2020 for testing. In the case of the Chicago city\\ndataset, we evaluated the model using all the data from Dec 2021.\\n\u2022(ii)Classical Supervised Prediction : For evaluation purposes,\\nwe chose the data with the longest time interval, which involved\\ntesting the model using all the data from the NYC-bike and NYC-\\ntaxi datasets specifically for the month of December 2021.\\nA.1.4 Baseline Details. To facilitate our discussion, we have\\ncategorized all the baselines into three distinct categories: RNN-\\nbased models, attention-based models, and graph neural network(GNN)-based spatio-temporal prediction models. Below, we provide\\ndetailed descriptions of each baseline category:\\nRNN-based Spatio-Temporal Methods:\\n\u2022ST-LSTM [33]: It incorporates the Long Short-Term Memory to\\ncapture temporal dependencies in the spatio-temporal data.\\n\u2022AGCRN [1]: RNNs are employed to capture temporal correlations,\\nallowing for the representation of the evolving patterns over time.\\n\u2022DMVSTNET [39]: In this method, RNNs are utilized to effectively\\nmodel temporal dependencies, capturing the patterns that evolve\\nover time. Furthermore, convolutional networks and fully con-\\nnected layers are employed to capture local spatial correlations\\nand establish meaningful spatial relationships.\\nAttention-based Spatio-Temporal Approaches:\\n\u2022ASTGCN [8]: In this method, attention mechanisms are employed\\nto capture multi-granularity temporal correlation features.\\n\u2022STWA [5]: The model incorporates personalized temporal and\\nspatial parameters into the attention module, allowing for the\\nmodeling of dynamic spatio-temporal correlations.\\nSpatio-Temporal GNNs:\\n\u2022GWN [37]: It incorporates a learnable graph structure and 1-D\\nconvolutions to effectively learn spatio-temporal dependencies.\\n\u2022MTGNN [36]: It utilizes a learnable graph structure to model\\nmultivariate temporal correlations. MTGNN employs 1-D dilation\\nconvolutions to generate temporal representations.\\n\u2022TGCN [47]: This model combines graph neural networks (GNNs)\\nfor spatial correlation modeling and recurrent neural networks\\n(RNNs) for temporal correlation modeling.\\n\u2022STGCN [42]: It uses gated temporal convolutions and GNNs to\\nmodel temporal and spatial dependencies, respectively.\\n\u2022STSGCN [26]: It introduces a spatio-temporal graph construction\\nto learn spatial correlations across adjacent time steps.\\nA.2 Case study\\nIn this section, we assess the effectiveness of different large lan-\\nguage models (LLMs) in zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction sce-\\nnarios, as illustrated in Table 3 and Table 4. The instructions pro-\\nvided to the models are clearly indicated in blue font. The results\\ndemonstrate that various LLMs are capable of generating predic-\\ntions based on these instructions, thereby highlighting the effective-\\nness of the prompt design. For instance, ChatGPT relies on historical\\naverages rather than explicitly incorporating temporal or spatial\\ndata in its predictions. Llama-2-70b analyzes specific time periods\\nand regions, but it encounters challenges in encoding numerical\\ntime-series dependencies, resulting in suboptimal predictive perfor-\\nmance. On the other hand, Claude-2.1 effectively summarizes and\\nanalyzes historical data, leveraging peak-hour patterns and points\\nof interest to achieve more accurate traffic trend predictions.\\nOur proposed UrbanGPT seamlessly integrates spatio-temporal\\ncontextual signals with the reasoning capabilities of large language\\nmodels (LLMs) through a spatio-temporal instruction-tuning para-\\ndigm. This integration leads to remarkable improvements in predict-\\ning numerical values and spatio-temporal trends. These findings\\nunderscore the potential and effectiveness of our framework in\\ncapturing universal spatio-temporal patterns, making zero-shot\\nspatio-temporal prediction practical and achievable.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 11\\n\\nTable 3: We examine the zero-shot predictions of different LLMs for bicycle flow in NYC with the provided instructions.\\nInstructions: Given the historical data for bike flow over 12 time steps in a specific region of New York City, the recorded bike inflows\\nare [12 8 9 15 10 12 14 9 6 12 25 20], and the recorded bike outflows are [5 12 12 15 10 11 6 9 4 6 10 15].

To improve prediction accuracy, a spatio-temporal model is\\nutilized to encode the historical bike data as tokens <ST_Start><ST_HIS><ST_HIS><ST_End>, where the first and the second tokens\\ncorrespond to the representations of bike inflow and outflow. Please conduct an analysis of the traffic patterns in this region, taking into\\naccount the provided time and regional information, and then generate the predictions (the predictive tokens for regression).\\nGround true: Based on the given information, the predictions of bike inflow and outflow in this region are [26 38 28 24 20 13 16 9 5 3\\n5 2] and[12 19 10 10 11 9 6 5 4 4 2 2] .\\nLlama-2-70b Responds: Based on the provided historical data, I have ...

The bike inflows range from 6 to 15 per 30-minute interval, while outflows range\\nfrom 4 to 15.Given the region covers education, cultural, commercial, and transportation facilities within a 1km radius, the bike traffic\\nlikely corresponds to people traveling to and from these points of interest. The fluctuations could reflect class/work schedules and\\ntransportation needs throughout the day.For the evening prediction period of 6PM to 11:30PM, we may expect some further fluctuations\\nbut generally declining bike traffic as the day turns to night. People would be finishing up activities and heading home. I would predict\\nthe following bike inflows and outflows for the next 12 time steps: [10 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 1 1] and[8 6 5 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 1 1] ...\\nUrbanGPT Responds: Based on the given information, the predictions (predicted tokens) of bike inflow and outflow in this region are\\n<ST_PRE> [20 21 22 21 17 12 9 7 6 5 5 5] and <ST_PRE> [11 10 8 7 6 6 5 4 4 3 3 2] .\\nTable 4: Zero-shot predictions of different LLMs for taxi flow in NYC with the provided instructions (without spatial information).\\nInstructions: Given the historical data for taxi flow over 12 time steps in a specific region of New York City, the recorded taxi inflows\\nare [111 86 90 78 49 75 46 32 20 14 9 9], and the recorded taxi outflows are [100 91 58 39 47 47 19 22 21 9 16 10].

We can expect lower taxi\\ndemand during later Sunday evening, with some pickup around end-of-weekend times and early Monday commute times. The region\\nis unspecified, so we cannot infer any location-specific usage patterns. Inflow ranges from 49-111 taxis over the 30 minute intervals.\\nOutflow ranges from 19-100 taxis.

This has significant implications in the field\\nof urban computing, where the ability to predict transportation\\npatterns can optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance\\noverall urban mobility [ 18,31]. Moreover, anticipating population\\nmovement can aid in effective urban planning and resource alloca-\\ntion [ 7,20]. Additionally, the ability to forecast crimes can greatly\\ncontribute to enhancing public safety [ 32]. Spatio-temporal predic-\\ntion plays a vital role in shaping smarter and more efficient cities,\\nultimately leading to an improved quality of urban life.\\nIt is important to highlight the various types of neural network\\narchitectures commonly adopted in this domain of spatio-temporal\\nprediction. These architectures are designed to capture and model\\nthe complex relationships between spatial and temporal dimensions\\nin the data. One widely employed architecture is the Convolutional\\nNeural Network (CNN) [ 15,39,45], which is effective in extract-\\ning spatial features by applying convolutional filters across the\\ninput data. Another line of spatio-temporal neural networks is the\\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) family [ 1,34,43]. Those spatio-\\ntemporal RNNs are well-suited for capturing temporal dependencies\\nby maintaining a memory state that can retain information over\\ntime. Recently, there has been a surge in the use of Graph Neural\\nNetworks (GNNs) for spatio-temporal prediction [ 36,40,47]. GNNs\\nexcel in modeling complex spatial relationships in data represented\\nas graphs, where each node corresponds to a spatial location and\\nedges capture the connections between them.\\nWhile current spatio-temporal neural network techniques have\\nproven to be highly effective, it is crucial to acknowledge their\\nstrong dependence on having an abundance of labeled data in order\\nto generate accurate predictions. However, the pervasive problem\\nof data scarcity in practical urban sensing scenarios poses a sig-\\nnificant challenge. For example, deploying sensors throughout the\\nentire urban space to monitor citywide traffic volume or air qual-\\nity is impractical due to the high cost involved [ 17,41]. Moreover,\\nthe challenge of limited labeled data availability extends to spatio-\\ntemporal forecasting across different cities, in which acquiring\\nlabeled data for each target city becomes a daunting task [ 13,38].\\nThese issues emphasize the pressing need for novel solutions that\\naddress data scarcity and enhance the generalization capabilities of\\nspatio-temporal models in various smart city applications.\\nInspired by the remarkable progress of large language models\\n(LLMs), our primary goal is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that\\npossesses outstanding generalization capabilities across a wide\\narray of urban tasks. Leveraging the reasoning abilities inherent in\\nLLMs, we aim to expand their success into the domain of spatio-\\ntemporal analysis. Our objective is to develop a model that can\\neffectively comprehend and forecast intricate spatial and temporal\\npatterns, enabling it to excel in various urban scenarios.\\nWhile it is of utmost importance to develop a versatile spatio-\\ntemporal model capable of effectively handling diverse downstreamarXiv:2403.00813v3  [cs.CL]  19 May 2024\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 2\\n\\nInstruction s:Given thehistorical data fortaxiflow over 12time steps inaspecific region ofNew York City, the\\nrecorded taxiinflows are[9194100 939376676650695542],and therecorded taxioutflows are[9691108\\n10283787674106938657]\u2026Please predict thetaxiinflow and outflow fornext 12time steps\u2026\\nLabel s:Taxi Inflow :[5536333033273714167512]Taxi Outflow :[547069593231292120111312].\\nOurs :Based onthegiven information, thepredictions oftaxiinflow and outflow inthisregion are\u2026\\nPrediction :Inflow :[514845424038332824211816]Outflow :[544945413835302521181614].\\nHuman\\nInstructions\\nLLAMA -70BGround true\\nPrediction :Inflow :[282827262524232323232424]Outflow :[343128252219171616151515] Baseline\\nLLM :There isanoticeable spike intaxiinflows and outflows around 10:00-11:00,which may indicate asurge in\\ndemand fortaxiservices\u2026Ihave created apredictive model toforecast thetaxiflow forthenext 12time steps :\\nPrediction :Inflow :[53586460677378849196102 108]Outflow :[5661687379848995102 107 113 119]\\nUrbanGPT\\n2 4 6 8 10 12\\nTime Steps020406080100 Inflow Predicted valueBaseline\\nLLM\\nOurs\\nGround_true\\n2 4 6 8 10 12\\nTime Steps020406080100120 Outflow Predicted valueBaseline\\nLLM\\nOurs\\nGround_trueFigure 1: The superior predictive performance of the pro-\\nposed UrbanGPT compared to the large language model\\n(LLaMA-70B) and the spatiotemporal graph neural network\\n(STGCN) in a zero-shot traffic flow prediction scenario.\\ntasks, aligning the spatio-temporal context with the knowledge\\nspace of large language models (LLMs) and enabling them to com-\\nprehend the complex dependencies across time and space present\\nsignificant challenges. These hurdles call for meticulous model\\ndesign to bridge the gap between the unique characteristics of\\nspatio-temporal data and the knowledge encoded within LLMs.\\nContributions . In light of these challenges, we propose UrbanGPT,\\na large language model specifically tailored for spatio-temporal\\nprediction. At the core of UrbanGPT lies a novel spatio-temporal\\ninstruction-tuning paradigm that seeks to align the intricate de-\\npendencies of time and space, with the knowledge space of LLMs.\\nWithin our UrbanGPT framework, we start by incorporating a\\nspatio-temporal dependency encoder, which utilizes a multi-level\\ntemporal convolutional network. This encoder enables the model\\nto capture the intricate temporal dynamics present in the spatio-\\ntemporal data across various time resolutions. Then, our model\\ninvolves aligning textual and spatio-temporal information to em-\\npower language models in effectively injecting spatio-temporal\\ncontextual signals. This is achieved through the utilization of a\\nlightweight alignment module that projects the representations\\nof spatio-temporal dependencies. The result is the generation of\\nmore expressive semantic representations by integrating valuable\\ninformation from both textual and spatio-temporal domains.\\nThrough the incorporation of spatio-temporal information dur-\\ning the instruction-tuning process, the language model gains profi-\\nciency in understanding and processing the intricate relationships\\nand patterns found in spatio-temporal data. By leveraging the in-\\nsights obtained from the spatio-temporal domain, the language\\nmodel becomes better equipped to capture the nuances and com-\\nplexities of spatio-temporal phenomena. This, in turn, enables the\\nmodel to make more reliable and insightful predictions across vari-\\nous urban scenarios, even when faced with limited data availability.\\nTo showcase the superior predictive performance of our pro-\\nposed model, we compare it with the large language model (LLaMA-\\n70B) and the spatio-temporal graph neural network (STGCN) in azero-shot traffic flow prediction scenario guided by textual instruc-\\ntions, as depicted in Figure 1. The large language model, LLaMA,\\neffectively infers traffic patterns from the input text. However, its\\nlimitations in handling numeric time-series data with complex spa-\\ntial and temporal dependencies can sometimes lead to opposite\\ntraffic trend predictions. On the other hand, the pre-trained base-\\nline model demonstrates a strong understanding of spatio-temporal\\ndependencies. However, it may suffer from overfitting to the source\\ndataset and underperform in zero-shot scenarios, indicating its lim-\\nited generalization capabilities beyond existing spatio-temporal\\nprediction models. In contrast, our proposed model achieves a har-\\nmonious integration of domain-specific spatio-temporal knowledge\\nand language modeling capabilities. This enables us to make more\\naccurate and reliable predictions under data scarcity.\\nIn summary, our main contributions can be outlined as follows:\\n\u2022To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop\\na spatio-temporal large language model capable of predicting\\ndiverse urban phenomena across different datasets, especially\\nunder conditions of limited data availability.\\n\u2022We propose UrbanGPT, a spatio-temporal prediction framework\\nthat empowers large language models (LLMs) to comprehend\\nthe intricate inter-dependencies across time and space. This is\\nachieved through the seamless integration of a spatio-temporal\\ndependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm, ef-\\nfectively aligning the spatio-temporal context with LLMs.\\n\u2022Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets\\nprovide compelling evidence of our proposed UrbanGPT\u2019s excep-\\ntional ability to generalize in zero-shot spatio-temporal learning\\nscenarios. These findings highlight the model\u2019s robust general-\\nization capacity, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately\\npredicting and understanding spatio-temporal patterns, even in\\nscenarios where no prior training data is available.\\n2 PRELIMINARIES\\nSpatio-Temporal Data . Spatio-temporal data is commonly col-\\nlected and can be represented as a three-dimensional tensor X\u2208\\nR\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc47\u00d7\ud835\udc39. Each element X\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udc53in the tensor corresponds to the value\\nof the\ud835\udc53-th feature at the \ud835\udc61-th time interval in the \ud835\udc5f-th region. To\\nprovide an example, let\u2019s consider predicting taxi traffic patterns in\\nan urban area. In this scenario, the data can represent the inflow\\nand outflow of taxis in a specific region ( e.g., the\ud835\udc5f-th spatial area)\\nduring a given time period from \ud835\udc61to\ud835\udc61\u22121(e.g., a 30-minute interval).\\nSpatio-Temporal Forecasting. In spatio-temporal prediction tasks,\\na common scenario involves forecasting future trends using histor-\\nical data. Specifically, the goal is to predict the data for the next \ud835\udc43\\ntime steps based on information from the preceding \ud835\udc3bsteps.\\nX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+\ud835\udc43=\ud835\udc53(X\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e\u2212\ud835\udc3b+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e) (1)\\nThe function \ud835\udc53(\u00b7)represents a spatio-temporal prediction model\\nthat has been trained effectively using historical data. Spatio-temporal\\nprediction tasks can be divided into two main categories: regression\\nprediction, which involves predicting continuous values like traffic\\nflow or taxi demand [ 22], and classification prediction, where the\\ngoal is to classify events such as crime occurrence prediction [ 11].\\nTo optimize the model \ud835\udc53(\u00b7), different loss functions are utilized\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 3\\n\\nbased on the specific characteristics of the spatio-temporal scenar-\\nios.\\nSpatio-Temporal Zero-Shot Learning . Despite the effectiveness\\nof current spatio-temporal learning approaches, they often en-\\ncounter difficulties in effectively generalizing across a wide range of\\ndownstream spatio-temporal learning scenarios. In this study, our\\nfocus is on addressing the challenge of spatio-temporal zero-shot\\nscenarios, where we aim to learn from previously unseen data in\\ndownstream spatio-temporal prediction datasets or tasks. This can\\nbe formally defined as follows:\\n\u02dcX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+\ud835\udc43=\u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u02dcX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e\u2212\ud835\udc3b+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e) (2)\\nIn this particular scenario, the prediction function \u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u00b7)is responsi-\\nble for forecasting the spatio-temporal data \u02dcXfrom downstream\\ntasks that have not been previously encountered. It should be noted\\nthat the model \u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u00b7)is not trained specifically on the target data.\\n3 METHODOLOGY\\n3.1 Spatio-Temporal Dependency Encoder\\nAlthough large language models demonstrate exceptional profi-\\nciency in language processing, they face challenges in comprehend-\\ning the time-evolving patterns inherent in spatio-temporal data. To\\novercome this limitation, we propose enhancing the capability of\\nlarge language models to capture temporal dependencies within\\nspatio-temporal contexts. This is accomplished by integrating a\\nspatio-temporal encoder that incorporates a multi-level tempo-\\nral convolutional network. By doing so, we enable the model to\\neffectively capture the intricate temporal dependencies across vari-\\nous time resolutions, thereby improving its understanding of the\\ncomplex temporal dynamics present in the spatio-temporal data.\\nSpecifically, our spatio-temporal encoder is composed of two key\\ncomponents: a gated dilated convolution layer and a multi-level\\ncorrelation injection layer. Let\u2019s formalize this architecture as:\\n\u03a8(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f=(\u00afW(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc58\u2217E(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+\u00afb(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc58)\u00b7\ud835\udeff(\u00afW(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc54\u2217E(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+\u00afb(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc54)+E\u2032(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f (3)\\nWe begin with the initial spatio-temporal embedding, denoted as\\nE\ud835\udc5f\u2208R\ud835\udc47\u00d7\ud835\udc51. This embedding is obtained by enhancing the original\\ndata Xthrough a linear layer. To address the issue of gradient\\nvanishing, we utilize a slice of E\ud835\udc5f, denoted as E\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5f\u2208R\ud835\udc47\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51, which\\nis determined by the size of the dilated convolutional kernel. This\\nslice is employed for performing residual operations. To perform\\nthe residual operations, we use 1-D dilated convolution kernels\\n\u00afW\ud835\udc58and \u00afW\ud835\udc54\u2208R\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc54\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61, along with the corresponding bias\\nterms \u00afb\ud835\udc58and \u00afb\ud835\udc54\u2208R\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61. The sigmoid activation function \ud835\udeffis\\napplied to control the degree of information preservation during the\\nrepeated convolution operation. After the gated temporal dilated\\nconvolutional layer encoding, we are able to effectively capture the\\ntemporal dependencies across multiple time steps, resulting in the\\ngeneration of temporal representations.\\nThese representations contain different levels of temporal de-\\npendencies, reflecting various granularity-aware time-evolving pat-\\nterns. To preserve these informative patterns, we introduce a multi-\\nlevel correlation injection layer. This layer is designed to incorpo-\\nrate correlations between different levels and is formalized as:\\nS(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f=(W(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc60\u2217\u03a8(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+b(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc60)+S(\ud835\udc59\u22121)\\n\ud835\udc5f (4)We have the convolution kernel W\ud835\udc60\u2208R\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc46\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\u00d7\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61and the bias\\nvector b\ud835\udc60\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61. These are employed after \ud835\udc3flayers of encoding.\\nA simple non-linear layer is employed to merge the results from\\nequations 3 and 4, and the final spatio-temporal dependency repre-\\nsentations of are denoted as \u02dc\u03a8\u2208R\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc39\u00d7\ud835\udc51. To address the diverse\\nset of urban scenarios that may arise downstream, our proposed\\nspatio-temporal encoder is designed to be independent of graph\\nstructures when modeling spatial correlations. This is particularly\\ncrucial because in zero-shot prediction contexts, the spatial rela-\\ntionships between entities may be unknown or difficult to ascertain.\\nBy not relying on explicit graph structures, our encoder can effec-\\ntively handle a broad spectrum of urban scenarios, where spatial\\ncorrelations and dependencies can vary or be challenging to define\\nin advance. This flexibility enables our model to adapt and perform\\nwell, ensuring its applicability in a wide range of urban contexts.\\n3.2 Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning\\n3.2.1 Spatio-Temporal-Text Alignment. In order to enable lan-\\nguage models to effectively comprehend spatio-temporal patterns,\\nit is crucial to align textual and spatio-temporal information. This\\nalignment allows for the fusion of different modalities, resulting\\nin a more informative representation. By integrating contextual\\nfeatures from both textual and spatio-temporal domains, we can\\ncapture complementary information and extract higher-level se-\\nmantic representations that are more expressive and meaningful.\\nTo achieve this objective, we utilize a lightweight alignment mod-\\nule to project the spatio-temporal dependencies representations\\n\u02dc\u03a8. This projection involves the use of parameters W\ud835\udc5d\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f\\nandb\ud835\udc5d\u2208R\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, where\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3frepresents the commonly used hidden\\ndimension in language models (LLMs).\\nThe resulting projection, denoted as H\u2208R\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc39\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, are rep-\\nresented in the instructions using special tokens as: <ST_start>,\\n<ST_HIS>, ..., <ST_HIS>, <ST_end>. Here, <ST_start> and <ST_end>\\nserve as identifiers marking the beginning and end of the spatio-\\ntemporal token. These identifiers can be included in the large-\\nscale language model by expanding its vocabulary. The placeholder\\n<ST_HIS> represents the spatio-temporal token and corresponds to\\nthe projection Hin the hidden layer. By employing this technique,\\nthe model gains the ability to discern spatio-temporal dependen-\\ncies, thereby enhancing its proficiency in successfully performing\\nspatio-temporal predictive tasks within urban scenes.\\n3.2.2 Spatio-Temporal Prompt Instructions. In scenarios in-\\nvolving spatio-temporal prediction, both temporal and spatial in-\\nformation contain valuable semantic details that contribute to the\\nmodel\u2019s understanding of spatio-temporal patterns within specific\\ncontexts. For instance, traffic flow in the early morning differs sig-\\nnificantly from rush hour, and there are variations in traffic patterns\\nbetween commercial and residential areas. As a result, we recognize\\nthe potential of representing both temporal and spatial information\\nas prompt instruction text. We leverage the text understanding\\ncapabilities of large language models to encode this information,\\nenabling associative reasoning for downstream tasks.\\nIn our UrbanGPT framework, we integrate multi-granularity\\ntime information and spatial details as instruction inputs for the\\nlarge language model. Time information includes factors such as\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 4\\n\\nl = 1l = 2l = 3\\nGateSpatio -Temporal dependenc yencoder\\nLLMs spaceLightweight alignment moduleSpatio -Temporal Instruction -Tuning\\nGiven the historical data and the corresponding tokens\\n<ST_HIS> fortaxi flow \u2026The recording time \u2026This region\\nislocated \u2026Please generate thepredictive tokens for\u2026\\nBased onthe given information, the predictive tokens\\noftaxi inflow and outflow inthis region are<ST_PRE> \u2026\\nLarge Language Models\\nInflow\uff1a[28 26 20 33 49  50 48 34 40 22 \u2026]\\nOutflow\uff1a[40 52 58 32 22 10 18 19 20 24\u2026]City A\\nCity B\\n\u2026\\nInstruction -Tuning Zero -shot prediction\\n<ST_HIS> <ST_HIS> Multi -tasks\\nRegression Layer<ST_HIS> <ST_ PRE> \\ntokens\\nText Replacement\\nLlama VicunaAlignment\\nRegressionST Encoder\\nTask assignment\\nText instructionsInstructions\\nResponsesRegion A\\nRegion B\\nFrozen Trainable\\n\u2026\\nSpatio -Temporal Zero -shot prediction\\nTrain city\\nTest cityTrain region\\nTest region\\nST dependency representations ST Instruction -Tuning of LLMsFigure 2: The overall architecture of the proposed spatio-temporal language model UrbanGPT.\\nTemporal Information :The recording time ofthehistorical data is'January 7,2020 ,08:30,\\nTuesday toJanuary 7,2020 ,14:00,Tuesday, with data points recorded at30-minute intervals' .\\nSpatial Information :Here istheregion information :This region islocated within theStaten\\nIsland borough district and encompasses various POIs within athree -kilometer radius,\\ncovering Public Safety, Education Facility, Residential categories .\\nTask description :Now wewant topredict thetaxi inflow and outflow forthenext 12time\\nsteps during thetime period of'January 7,2020 ,14:30,Tuesday toJanuary 7,2020 ,20:00,\\nTuesday, with data points recorded at30-minute intervals' .\\nFigure 3: Illustration of spatio-temporal prompt instructions\\nencoding the time- and location-aware information.\\nthe day of the week and the hour of the day, while regional in-\\nformation encompasses the city, administrative areas, and nearby\\npoints of interest (POI) data, among others. By incorporating these\\ndiverse elements, UrbanGPT is capable of identifying and assimi-\\nlating spatio-temporal patterns across different regions and time-\\nframes. This enables the model to encapsulate these insights within\\ncomplex spatio-temporal contexts, thereby enhancing its ability\\nfor zero-shot reasoning. The design of the instructional text for\\nspatio-temporal information is illustrated in Figure 3.\\n3.2.3 Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning of LLMs. When\\nit comes to incorporating detailed spatio-temporal textual descrip-\\ntions, the next stage is to fine-tune large language models (LLMs)\\nusing instructions to generate spatio-temporal forecasts in textual\\nformat. However, this approach poses two challenges. Firstly , spatio-\\ntemporal forecasting typically relies on numerical data, which dif-\\nfers in structure and patterns from natural language that language\\nmodels excel at processing, focusing on semantic and syntactic rela-\\ntionships. Secondly , large language models are typically pre-trained\\nusing a multi-classification loss to predict vocabulary, resulting in a\\nprobability distribution of potential outcomes. This contrasts with\\nthe continuous value distribution required for regression tasks.\\nTo address these challenges, UrbanGPT adopts a different strat-\\negy by refraining from directly predicting future spatio-temporal\\nvalues. Instead, it generates forecasting tokens that aid in the pre-\\ndiction process. These tokens are subsequently passed through a\\nregression layer, which maps the hidden representations to generate\\nmore accurate predictive values. The formulation of the regressionlayer in our spatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm is:\\n\u02c6Y\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53=W3[\ud835\udf0e(W1H\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53),\ud835\udf0e(W2\u0393\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53)] (5)\\nThe prediction result, denoted as \u02c6Y\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53\u2208R\ud835\udc43, is obtained using the\\nrectified linear unit activation function, represented by \ud835\udf0e. The hid-\\nden representations of the forecasting tokens, denoted as \u0393\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53\u2208\\nR\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, are introduced as a novel term in the vocabulary of large lan-\\nguage models (LLMs). The regression layer is formulated using\\nweight matrices W1\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f,W2\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, and W3\u2208R\ud835\udc43\u00d72\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n,\\nwhere[\u00b7,\u00b7]represents the concatenation operation. While the prob-\\nability distribution of the forecasting tokens remains relatively\\nstable, their hidden representations contain rich spatio-temporal\\ncontextual attributes that capture dynamic spatio-temporal interde-\\npendencies. This enables our model to provide precise predictions\\nby leveraging this contextual information.\\n3.3 Model Optimization\\nBuilding upon the baseline model [ 1,8], we adopt the absolute error\\nloss as our regression loss function. This choice allows us to effec-\\ntively handle predictions across a wide range of urban scenarios.\\nAdditionally, we introduce a classification loss as a joint loss to\\ncater to diverse task requirements. To ensure optimal performance,\\nour model optimizes different losses based on the specific task in-\\nputs. For instance, we utilize the regression loss for tasks such as\\ntraffic flow prediction, while employing the classification loss for\\ntasks like crime prediction. This approach enables our model to\\neffectively address the unique challenges posed by each task and\\ndeliver accurate predictions in various urban scenarios.\\nL\ud835\udc50=\u22121\\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01\\n\ud835\udc56=1[\ud835\udeff(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)\u00b7log(\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)+(1\u2212\ud835\udeff(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56))\u00b7log(1\u2212\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)]\\nL\ud835\udc5f=1\\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01\\n\ud835\udc56=1|\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\u2212\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56|;L=L\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc60+L\ud835\udc5f+L\ud835\udc50 (6)\\nHere,\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56represents a sample from \u02c6Y, and\ud835\udc41represents the total\\nnumber of samples, which is calculated as the product of \ud835\udc45,\ud835\udc47, and\\n\ud835\udc39. We use various loss functions in our model, including L\ud835\udc50for\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 5\\n\\nbinary cross-entropy loss, L\ud835\udc5ffor regression loss, and the cross-\\nentropy loss adopted in our spatio-temporal language models. To\\ncapture probability distributions from the prediction, we employ\\nthe sigmoid function denoted by \ud835\udeff. Each of these loss functions\\nplays a specific role in our model, allowing us to effectively handle\\nclassification, regression, and language modeling tasks as needed.\\n4 EVALUATION\\nIn this section, we aim to assess the capabilities of our proposed\\nmodel across various settings by addressing five key questions:\\n\u2022RQ1 : What is the performance and generalization capability of\\nUrbanGPT in diverse zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction tasks?\\n\u2022RQ2 : How does UrbanGPT perform when compared to existing\\nspatio-temporal models in classical supervised scenarios?\\n\u2022RQ3 : What specific contributions do the proposed key compo-\\nnents bring to enhance the capabilities of our UrbanGPT model?\\n\u2022RQ4 : Can the proposed model robustly handle the forecasting\\nscenarios with varying spatio-temporal patterns?\\n4.1 Experimental Setting\\n4.1.1 Dataset Description. To evaluate the effectiveness of the\\nproposed model in predicting spatio-temporal patterns across var-\\nious urban computing scenarios, we conducted experiments us-\\ning four distinct datasets: NYC-taxi, NYC-bike, NYC-crime, and\\nCHI-taxi. These datasets encompass a wide range of data sources\\nto capture the dynamic nature of urban environments, including\\nrecords of taxi travel, bike trajectories, crime incidents in New York\\nCity, and taxi travel data in Chicago. To facilitate our analysis, we\\npartitioned the cities into grid-like regions based on latitude and\\nlongitude information. Within specific time intervals, we aggre-\\ngated statistical measures for each region. For example, this in-\\nvolved calculating the number of taxi inflows and outflows within\\na 30-minute period in region A, or determining the count of theft\\nincidents within a day in region B. Furthermore, Points of Interest\\n(POIs) data can be obtained through APIs provided by map services,\\nutilizing the latitude and longitude of different regions. For more\\ncomprehensive data descriptions, please refer to the Appendix.\\n4.1.2 Evaluation Protocols. In order to investigate the capabili-\\nties of large language models in analyzing diverse spatio-temporal\\ndata across different regions, we selected a subset of taxi, bike, and\\ncrime data from various areas of New York City as our training set.\\n\u2022Zero-Shot Learning Scenarios . We assessed the model perfor-\\nmance by predicting future spatio-temporal data from regions in\\nNYC or even Chicago that were unseen in the training phase.\\n\u2022Supervised Learning Scenarios . We evaluated the model using\\nfuture data from the same regions as the training set.\\nFor regression tasks, we maintained a consistent training and test-\\ning methodology across all baseline models. When it came to classi-\\nfication tasks involving crime data, we utilized binary cross-entropy\\nas the loss function for training and testing the models. Our ex-\\nperiments were conducted using the robust vicuna-7b [ 50] as the\\nfoundational large language model for UrbanGPT. For a more com-\\nprehensive understanding of our methodology and experimental\\nsetup, please refer to the appendix for detailed information.4.1.3 Evaluation Metrics. For regression tasks, we employed\\nMAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)\\nas evaluation metrics. These metrics quantify the discrepancies\\nbetween the predicted outcomes and the actual labels, with lower\\nvalues indicating superior performance [ 12,49]. In the case of clas-\\nsification tasks, we utilized Recall and Macro-F1 as evaluation met-\\nrics to assess performance. Recall measures the model\u2019s ability to\\ncorrectly identify positive instances, while Macro-F1 is a compre-\\nhensive performance metric that combines precision and recall to\\nprovide an overall measure of classification accuracy [11, 30].\\n4.1.4 Baseline Model. We conducted a thorough comparison\\nwith 10 advanced models to establish baselines for our proposed\\nmethod. (i)In the category of RNNs-based spatio-temporal forecast-\\ning methods, we compared our proposed method with AGCRN [ 1],\\nDMVSTNET [ 39] and ST-LSTM [ 33]. These approaches leverage\\nRNNs for modeling and prediction. (ii)The GNNs-based spatio-\\ntemporal models primarily utilize graph neural networks to cap-\\nture spatial correlations and integrate temporal encoders to capture\\nspatio-temporal relationships. The models we compared against\\nin this category include GWN [ 37], MTGNN [ 36], STSGCN [ 26],\\nTGCN [ 47], and STGCN [ 42].(iii) In the attention-based spatio-\\ntemporal models category, the methods employ attention mecha-\\nnisms to model spatio-temporal correlations. The models we com-\\npared against in this category are ASTGCN [8] and STWA [5].\\n4.2 Zero-Shot Prediction Performance (RQ1)\\nIn this section, we thoroughly evaluate the predictive performance\\nof our proposed model in zero-shot scenarios. The results of our\\nevaluation are presented in Table 1 and visualized in Figure 4. Our\\nobjective is to assess the model\u2019s effectiveness in predicting spatio-\\ntemporal patterns in geographical areas that it has not encountered\\nduring training. This evaluation encompasses both cross-region\\nand cross-city settings, allowing us to gain insights into the model\u2019s\\ngeneralization capabilities across different locations.\\n4.2.1 Prediction on Unseen Regions within a City. Cross-\\nregion scenarios entail using data from certain regions within a\\ncity to forecast future conditions in other regions that have not\\nbeen encountered by the model. Through a thorough analysis of\\nthe model\u2019s performance in these cross-region predictions, we can\\ndraw attention to three significant observations:\\ni) Superior Zero-shot Predictive Performance . The results pre-\\nsented in Table 1 highlight the exceptional performance of our\\nproposed model in both regression and classification tasks on vari-\\nous datasets, surpassing the baseline models in zero-shot prediction.\\nThe success of our model can be attributed to two key factors.\\n\u2022Spatio-Temporal-Text-Alignment . The alignment of spatio-\\ntemporal contextual signals with the text comprehension abil-\\nities of language models plays a pivotal role in the success of\\nour proposed model.

This adaptive tuning\\nprocess empowers the LLM to effectively integrate crucial in-\\nformation from the instructions, enhancing its comprehension\\nof the complex relationships and dependencies between spatial\\nand temporal factors. By seamlessly merging the spatio-temporal\\ninstruction-tuning with the spatio-temporal dependency encoder,\\nour proposed model, UrbanGPT, successfully preserves universal\\nand transferable spatio-temporal knowledge. Consequently, the\\nmodel becomes capable of capturing the fundamental patterns\\nand dynamics that govern spatio-temporal phenomena, enabling\\nit to make precise predictions in downstream zero-shot scenarios.\\nii) Enhanced Urban Semantic Understanding . Urban seman-\\ntics offer valuable insights into the diverse dimensions of spatial\\nand temporal characteristics. Our approach involves training our\\nmodel on a wide range of datasets, enriching its understanding\\nof spatio-temporal dynamics across different timeframes and geo-\\ngraphical locations. In contrast, baseline models tend to prioritize\\nencoding temporal and spatial dependencies, neglecting the nu-\\nanced semantics that differentiate regions, timeframes, and data\\ncategories. By incorporating comprehensive semantic awareness\\ninto our UrbanGPT, we significantly enhance its ability to make\\naccurate zero-shot predictions in previously unseen regions.\\niii) Improved Performance in Sparse Data Scenarios . Predict-\\ning spatio-temporal patterns in sparse data environments is chal-\\nlenging as models tend to overfit when data points are scarce. This\\nchallenge is particularly notable when predicting crimes, where data\\nis often sparse but crucial for accurate predictions. Baseline mod-\\nels struggle in cross-regional prediction tasks under these sparse\\nconditions, resulting in low recall scores that indicate potential over-\\nfitting. To overcome this limitation, our model integrates spatio-\\ntemporal learning with large language models (LLMs) using an\\neffective spatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm. By incorpo-\\nrating rich semantic insights, our approach enhances the model\u2019s\\nspatio-temporal representations, enabling it to effectively handle\\nsparse data and achieve improved prediction accuracy.\\n4.2.2 Cross-City Prediction Task. To assess the performance of\\nour model in cross-city prediction tasks, we conducted tests on the\\nCHI-taxi dataset, which was not seen during the training phase. The\\nresults, depicted in Figure 4, yielded the following observations:\u2022Consistency in Multi-step Prediction : Our model consistently\\noutperforms the comparison method at each time step. Notably,\\nit maintains a significant advantage in both short-term and long-\\nterm spatio-temporal prediction, demonstrating the robustness\\nof our proposed model in cross-city prediction scenarios.\\n\u2022Effective Knowledge Transfer Across Cities : The prediction\\nresults obtained from the CHI-taxi dataset validate the supe-\\nrior forecasting capabilities of our model in cross-city scenarios.\\nThis enhancement can be attributed to the integration of spatio-\\ntemporal encoders with the spatio-temporal instruction-tuning\\nparadigm. By incorporating these components, our model ef-\\nfectively captures universal and transferable spatio-temporal\\npatterns, allowing it to make accurate predictions. Additionally,\\nby considering different geographical information and temporal\\nfactors alongside the learned transferred knowledge, our model\\nsuccessfully associates spatio-temporal patterns exhibited by\\nsimilar functional areas and historical periods. This comprehen-\\nsive understanding provides valuable insights for making precise\\nzero-shot predictions in cross-city scenarios.\\n4.3 Classical Supervised Prediction Task (RQ2)\\nThis section examines the predictive capabilities of our UrbanGPT\\nin end-to-end supervised prediction scenarios, as presented in Ta-\\nble 2. We will discuss the results from two perspectives below.\\nEnhanced Long-Term Forecasting Abilities : We examined the\\nmodel\u2019s effectiveness in long-term spatio-temporal forecasting by\\nutilizing test datasets that spanned broader time intervals. For in-\\nstance, we trained the model using data from 2017 and evaluated its\\nperformance on data from 2021. The results of these experiments\\ndemonstrate that our UrbanGPT possesses a significant advantage\\nover the baselines, highlighting its superior ability to generalize\\nacross different temporal landscapes. This capability reduces the\\nneed for frequent retraining or incremental updates, making the\\nmodel more aligned with real-world applications. Additionally, the\\nexperiments have confirmed that incorporating additional textual\\nknowledge does not hinder model performance or introduce noise,\\nthus further validating the feasibility of utilizing large language\\nmodels to enhance spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.\\nSpatial Semantic Understanding : Accurately capturing spatial\\ncorrelations is crucial in the realm of spatio-temporal prediction.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 7\\n\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon23456 MAE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOurs\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon3456789101112131415 RMSE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOurs\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon12345 MAE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOurs\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon456789101112131415 RMSE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOursFigure 4: Time step-based prediction comparison experiment conducted on the CHI-taxi dataset.\\nTable 2: Evaluation of performance in the end-to-end super-\\nvised setting on the NYC-taxi and NYC-bike datasets.\\nModelNYC-taxi NYC-bike\\nInflow Outflow Inflow Outflow\\nMAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE\\nAGCRN 2.83 8.35 2.62 9.21 3.30 7.65 3.38 7.73\\nASTGCN 5.41 18.04 5.00 19.29 3.87 7.93 3.66 7.69\\nGWN 3.91 11.93 2.89 10.85 4.30 9.04 3.88 8.29\\nMTGNN 3.09 10.13 2.61 10.96 3.31 7.47 3.26 7.61\\nSTWA 3.90 12.64 3.15 11.32 4.23 9.07 4.18 9.18\\nSTSGCN 4.57 13.93 4.41 15.87 5.10 12.23 4.72 10.78\\nSTGCN 3.45 9.82 3.17 10.53 3.88 9.23 3.90 9.08\\nTGCN 3.99 11.47 3.31 11.58 4.12 7.92 4.11 7.84\\nDMVSTNET 3.83 11.55 2.76 9.88 3.71 7.95 3.69 7.92\\nST-LSTM 7.78 15.41 6.92 17.12 5.00 11.52 4.96 11.41\\nUrbanGPT 2.50 6.78 1.71 6.68 3.11 7.10 3.01 6.94\\nTraditional methods often employ graph networks or attention\\nmechanisms to analyze these correlations.

Our\\nrigorous testing primarily revolves around the zero-shot scenario\\nusing the NYC-taxi dataset. Through our analysis, we have distilled\\nthe benefits offered by the different modules into four key points.\\n\u2022(1) Impact of Spatial and Temporal Context :-STC . By re-\\nmoving time and spatial information from the instruction text,\\nwe observed a noticeable decline in the model\u2019s performance.\\nThis can be attributed to the lack of temporal information, forcing\\nthe model to rely solely on spatio-temporal encoders for encoding\\ntime-related features and performing prediction tasks. Furthermore,\\nthe absence of spatial information hindered the model\u2019s ability to\\ncapture spatial correlations, making it challenging to analyze the\\ndistinct spatio-temporal patterns of different areas.\\n\u2022(2) Impact of Instruction-Tuning with Diverse Datasets :-\\nMulti .

As a result, the model\u2019s per-\\nformance was suboptimal. By integrating diverse spatio-temporal\\ndata from multiple sources, our model can effectively capture the\\nunique characteristics of different geographical locations and their\\nevolving spatio-temporal patterns.\\n\u2022(3) Impact of Spatio-Temporal Encoder :-STE . In this vari-\\nant, we disable the spatio-temporal encoder to investigate its\\neffect on aligning the large language model with encoded urban\\ndependency dynamics into latent embedding space.\\nThe results clearly indicate that the absence of the spatio-temporal\\nencoder significantly hampers the performance of the large lan-\\nguage model in spatio-temporal prediction scenarios. This under-\\nscores the crucial role played by the proposed spatio-temporal\\nencoder in enhancing the model\u2019s predictive capabilities.\\n\u2022(4) Regression Layer Incorporation in Instruction-Tuning:\\nT2P. We explicitly instructed UrbanGPT to generate its predic-\\ntions in a textual format. However, the suboptimal performance\\nindicates the challenges in utilizing LLMs for precise numerical\\nregression tasks, as opposed to employing regression layers.\\nThe primary challenge stems from the model\u2019s dependence on\\nmulti-class loss for optimization during training, leading to a mis-\\nmatch between the model\u2019s probabilistic output and the continuous\\nvalue distribution necessary for spatio-temporal forecasting. To\\nbridge this gap, we incorporated a regression predictor into our\\nmodel, significantly improving its capacity to generate more precise\\nnumerical predictions for regression tasks.\\n4.5 Model Robustness Study (RQ4)\\nIn this section, we focus on evaluating the robustness of our Ur-\\nbanGPT across different spatio-temporal pattern scenarios. We cate-\\ngorize regions based on the magnitude of numerical variations, such\\nas taxi flow, during a specific time period.

Deep spatio-temporal\\nprediction methods have gained prominence in deep learning due\\nto their impressive performance. These models typically consist of\\ntwo components: temporal dependency modeling and spatial corre-\\nlation encoding. Early models like D-LSTM [ 43] and ST-resnet [ 45]\\nused RNNs and convolutional networks to model temporal and\\nspatial dependencies. Graph neural networks (GNNs) proved to\\nbe a natural fit for spatial correlation modeling, as seen in models\\nlike STGCN [ 42] and DCRNN [ 14], which utilized graph structures\\nbased on node distances. Techniques such as learnable region-wise\\ngraph structures [ 36,37] and dynamic spatio-temporal graph net-\\nworks [9, 48] have further enhanced spatial correlation modeling.\\nFurthermore, researchers have explored approaches such as\\nmulti-scale temporal learning [ 34] and multi-granularity tempo-\\nral learning [ 8] to encode temporal dependencies. These strategies\\nenable the capture of features like long-term and short-term correla-\\ntions as well as periodicity. These advancements have significantlycontributed to the progress of spatio-temporal prediction. However,\\nit is worth noting that the majority of these studies are tailored\\nfor supervised contexts, with limited research and development\\nfocused on zero-shot spatio-temporal forecasting. This represents\\nan important area that requires further exploration.\\nSpatio-Temporal Pre-training . Spatio-temporal pre-training tech-\\nniques have recently received significant research attention. These\\ntechniques primarily focus on generative [ 16,24] and contrastive [ 46]\\npre-training models to enhance the predictive performance of down-\\nstream tasks. There has also been extensive exploration of pretrain-\\nfinetune frameworks for few-shot learning scenarios [ 13,19], aim-\\ning to improve knowledge transferability by aligning source and\\ntarget data. However, these approaches require training or fine-\\ntuning on target data and lack zero-shot prediction capabilities. In\\nthis work, we address the challenge of data scarcity in downstream\\nurban scenarios by proposing UrbanGPT. Our model demonstrates\\nthe ability to generalize well across various scenarios, mitigating\\nthe need for extensive training or fine-tuning on target data.\\nLarge Language Models. The emergence of large language mod-\\nels [3,21] has recently attracted significant attention due to their\\nunprecedented machine performance in tasks like text understand-\\ning and reasoning. These models have become a hot topic, demon-\\nstrating the potential to advance from intelligent algorithms to\\nartificial intelligence. Open-source large language models such as\\nLlama [ 28,29], Vicuna [ 50], and ChatGLM [ 44] have been released,\\nleading to researchers exploring their application in various fields\\nto enhance transfer learning capabilities with domain knowledge\\nfrom these models. In the computer vision domain, researchers\\nhave combined multimodal large language models with prompt\\nlearning methods to achieve zero-shot predictions in downstream\\ntasks [ 25,51,52]. Furthermore, the capabilities of LLMs in graph\\nreasoning [ 2,4,27], recommendation [ 10,23,35] and traffic anal-\\nysis [ 6] have been extensively studied. However, the utilization\\nof large language models for zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction\\ntasks in the field of urban intelligence remains largely unexplored.\\n6 CONCLUSION\\nWe present the UrbanGPT, a spatio-temporal large language model,\\nto generalize well in diverse urban scenarios. To seamlessly align\\nthe spatio-temporal contextual signals with LLMs, we introduce a\\nspatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm. This empowers the\\nUrbanGPT with the remarkable ability to learn universal and trans-\\nferable spatio-temporal patterns across various types of urban data.\\nThrough extensive experiments and meticulous ablation studies,\\nwe demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of the UrbanGPT\u2019s\\narchitecture and its key components. However, it is important to\\nacknowledge that while the results are promising, there are still\\nlimitations to be addressed in future studies. As a first step, we are\\nactively engaged in collecting a more diverse range of urban data\\nto enhance and refine the capabilities of our UrbanGPT across a\\nbroader spectrum of urban computing domains. Additionally, un-\\nderstanding the decision-making process of our UrbanGPT is of im-\\nportance. While the model demonstrates exceptional performance,\\nproviding interpretability and explainability is equally essential.\\nFuture research efforts will focus on empowering our model with\\nthe ability to interpret and explain its predictions.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 9\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n[1]Lei Bai, Lina Yao, Can Li, Xianzhi Wang, and Can Wang. 2020.

This includes detailed dataset informa-\\ntion, hyperparameter configuration, experimental setting for the\\ninstruction-tuning phase and test phase, as well as the baselines.\\nFurthermore, we present a case study of our UrbanGPT, showcasing\\nits effectiveness for zero-shot spatio-temporal predictions.\\nA.1 Experimental Details Description\\nA.1.1 Dataset Details. We collected data on taxi flows, bicycle\\nflows, and crime incidents in New York City for training and evalu-\\nation. The NYC-taxi dataset contains 263 regions, with each region\\nmeasuring approximately 3km x 3km. The time sampling inter-\\nval for this dataset is 30 minutes. The NYC-bike and NYC-crime\\ndatasets consist of 2162 regions, each represented by a 1km x 1km\\ngrid. The time sampling interval for NYC-bike is also 30 minutes,\\nwhile for NYC-crime, it is 1 day. All datasets cover the time period\\nfrom Jan 1, 2016, to Dec 31, 2021, in NYC. The CHI-taxi dataset\\nincludes 77 regions, with each region measuring approximately\\n4km x 4km. This dataset includes all taxi data from January 1, 2021,\\nto December 31, 2021, with a time sampling interval of 30 minutes.\\nA.1.2 Hyperparameters Settings. The parameters for the di-\\nlation convolution kernel in the time encoder are set as follows:\\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b,\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61, and\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61are all set to 32, with a dilation factor of 1. For\\nour prediction task, we aim to predict the next 12 steps of data\\nbased on the previous 12 steps. Both the history length ( \ud835\udc3b) and\\nprediction length ( \ud835\udc43) are set to 12. The projection layer parameters\\nare configured with \ud835\udc51set to 64 and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3fset to 4096. Lastly, the hidden\\nlayer parameter \ud835\udc51\u2032for the regression layer is set to 128.\\nA.1.3 Further Experimental Setup Descriptions. During the\\ninstruction-tuning phase, we randomly selected 80 regions from\\nthe three datasets in New York City as training data. It\u2019s important\\nto note that the region indices were kept consistent for the NYC-\\nbike and NYC-crime datasets. The training sets had specific time\\nintervals: for NYC-taxi datasets, it ranged from January 1, 2017,\\nto March 31, 2017; for NYC-bike datasets, it covered April 1, 2017,\\nto June 30, 2017; and for NYC-crime datasets, it spanned from\\nJanuary 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018. For the pretraining of the\\nspatio-temporal dependency encoder and the baseline models, we\\nutilized the same data for training to optimize the parameters. The\\nmaximum epoch count was set at 100. In the testing phase, we\\nconducted the following evaluations:\\n\u2022(i)Zero-Shot Prediction . We also selected an additional 80\\nregions from the New York City datasets as unseen test data. For\\nthe NYC-bike and NYC-taxi datasets, we used the first two weeks\\nof data in 2020 for testing. As for the NYC-crime dataset, we used\\nthe entire year of 2020 for testing. In the case of the Chicago city\\ndataset, we evaluated the model using all the data from Dec 2021.\\n\u2022(ii)Classical Supervised Prediction : For evaluation purposes,\\nwe chose the data with the longest time interval, which involved\\ntesting the model using all the data from the NYC-bike and NYC-\\ntaxi datasets specifically for the month of December 2021.\\nA.1.4 Baseline Details. To facilitate our discussion, we have\\ncategorized all the baselines into three distinct categories: RNN-\\nbased models, attention-based models, and graph neural network(GNN)-based spatio-temporal prediction models. Below, we provide\\ndetailed descriptions of each baseline category:\\nRNN-based Spatio-Temporal Methods:\\n\u2022ST-LSTM [33]: It incorporates the Long Short-Term Memory to\\ncapture temporal dependencies in the spatio-temporal data.\\n\u2022AGCRN [1]: RNNs are employed to capture temporal correlations,\\nallowing for the representation of the evolving patterns over time.\\n\u2022DMVSTNET [39]: In this method, RNNs are utilized to effectively\\nmodel temporal dependencies, capturing the patterns that evolve\\nover time. Furthermore, convolutional networks and fully con-\\nnected layers are employed to capture local spatial correlations\\nand establish meaningful spatial relationships.\\nAttention-based Spatio-Temporal Approaches:\\n\u2022ASTGCN [8]: In this method, attention mechanisms are employed\\nto capture multi-granularity temporal correlation features.\\n\u2022STWA [5]: The model incorporates personalized temporal and\\nspatial parameters into the attention module, allowing for the\\nmodeling of dynamic spatio-temporal correlations.\\nSpatio-Temporal GNNs:\\n\u2022GWN [37]: It incorporates a learnable graph structure and 1-D\\nconvolutions to effectively learn spatio-temporal dependencies.\\n\u2022MTGNN [36]: It utilizes a learnable graph structure to model\\nmultivariate temporal correlations. MTGNN employs 1-D dilation\\nconvolutions to generate temporal representations.\\n\u2022TGCN [47]: This model combines graph neural networks (GNNs)\\nfor spatial correlation modeling and recurrent neural networks\\n(RNNs) for temporal correlation modeling.\\n\u2022STGCN [42]: It uses gated temporal convolutions and GNNs to\\nmodel temporal and spatial dependencies, respectively.\\n\u2022STSGCN [26]: It introduces a spatio-temporal graph construction\\nto learn spatial correlations across adjacent time steps.\\nA.2 Case study\\nIn this section, we assess the effectiveness of different large lan-\\nguage models (LLMs) in zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction sce-\\nnarios, as illustrated in Table 3 and Table 4. The instructions pro-\\nvided to the models are clearly indicated in blue font. The results\\ndemonstrate that various LLMs are capable of generating predic-\\ntions based on these instructions, thereby highlighting the effective-\\nness of the prompt design. For instance, ChatGPT relies on historical\\naverages rather than explicitly incorporating temporal or spatial\\ndata in its predictions. Llama-2-70b analyzes specific time periods\\nand regions, but it encounters challenges in encoding numerical\\ntime-series dependencies, resulting in suboptimal predictive perfor-\\nmance. On the other hand, Claude-2.1 effectively summarizes and\\nanalyzes historical data, leveraging peak-hour patterns and points\\nof interest to achieve more accurate traffic trend predictions.\\nOur proposed UrbanGPT seamlessly integrates spatio-temporal\\ncontextual signals with the reasoning capabilities of large language\\nmodels (LLMs) through a spatio-temporal instruction-tuning para-\\ndigm. This integration leads to remarkable improvements in predict-\\ning numerical values and spatio-temporal trends. These findings\\nunderscore the potential and effectiveness of our framework in\\ncapturing universal spatio-temporal patterns, making zero-shot\\nspatio-temporal prediction practical and achievable.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 11\\n\\nTable 3: We examine the zero-shot predictions of different LLMs for bicycle flow in NYC with the provided instructions.\\nInstructions: Given the historical data for bike flow over 12 time steps in a specific region of New York City, the recorded bike inflows\\nare [12 8 9 15 10 12 14 9 6 12 25 20], and the recorded bike outflows are [5 12 12 15 10 11 6 9 4 6 10 15]. The recording time of the\\nhistorical data is \u2019January 14, 2020, 12:00, Tuesday to January 14, 2020, 17:30, Tuesday, with data points recorded at 30-minute intervals\u2019.\\nHere is the region information: This region is located within the Staten Island borough district and encompasses various POIs within a\\none-kilometer radius, covering Education Facility, Cultural Facility, Commercial, Transportation Facility categories. We now aim to\\npredict the bike inflow and outflow for the next 12 time steps during the time period of \u2019January 14, 2020, 18:00, Tuesday to January 14,\\n2020, 23:30, Tuesday, with data points recorded at 30-minute intervals\u2019. To improve prediction accuracy, a spatio-temporal model is\\nutilized to encode the historical bike data as tokens <ST_Start><ST_HIS><ST_HIS><ST_End>, where the first and the second tokens\\ncorrespond to the representations of bike inflow and outflow. Please conduct an analysis of the traffic patterns in this region, taking into\\naccount the provided time and regional information, and then generate the predictions (the predictive tokens for regression).\\nGround true: Based on the given information, the predictions of bike inflow and outflow in this region are [26 38 28 24 20 13 16 9 5 3\\n5 2] and[12 19 10 10 11 9 6 5 4 4 2 2] .\\nLlama-2-70b Responds: Based on the provided historical data, I have ... Here are my predictions for the bike inflow and outflow for the\\nnext 12 time steps:Bike Inflow: [15 18 20 15 12 10 14 12 10 15 18 20] . Bike Outflow: [10 12 15 10 11 12 10 9 6 10 12 15] .\\nThese predictions are based on the following analysis: Time of Day: The traffic patterns during this time are likely to be influenced by\\nthe evening rush hour, with increased bike inflows and outflows during the peak hours...Regional Information: ... This suggests that\\nthere may be a mix of both commuter and recreational bike traffic in the area...\\nChatGPT Responds: To analyze the traffic patterns in the given region and make predictions for the next 12 time steps, we can calculate\\nthe average bike inflow and outflow based on the historical data... Now, we can generate predictions for the next 12 time steps: Predicted\\nBike Inflow: [11.67 11.67... 11.67] . Predicted Bike Outflow: [9.58 9.58... 9.58] ...\\nClaude-2.1 Responds: Based on the provided historical data, this region in Staten Island seems to experience fluctuating yet relatively\\nlow bike traffic flow during the daytime on Tuesdays. The bike inflows range from 6 to 15 per 30-minute interval, while outflows range\\nfrom 4 to 15.Given the region covers education, cultural, commercial, and transportation facilities within a 1km radius, the bike traffic\\nlikely corresponds to people traveling to and from these points of interest. The fluctuations could reflect class/work schedules and\\ntransportation needs throughout the day.For the evening prediction period of 6PM to 11:30PM, we may expect some further fluctuations\\nbut generally declining bike traffic as the day turns to night. People would be finishing up activities and heading home. I would predict\\nthe following bike inflows and outflows for the next 12 time steps: [10 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 1 1] and[8 6 5 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 1 1] ...\\nUrbanGPT Responds: Based on the given information, the predictions (predicted tokens) of bike inflow and outflow in this region are\\n<ST_PRE> [20 21 22 21 17 12 9 7 6 5 5 5] and <ST_PRE> [11 10 8 7 6 6 5 4 4 3 3 2] .\\nTable 4: Zero-shot predictions of different LLMs for taxi flow in NYC with the provided instructions (without spatial information).\\nInstructions: Given the historical data for taxi flow over 12 time steps in a specific region of New York City, the recorded taxi inflows\\nare [111 86 90 78 49 75 46 32 20 14 9 9], and the recorded taxi outflows are [100 91 58 39 47 47 19 22 21 9 16 10]. The recording time of the\\nhistorical data is \u2019January 5, 2020, 20:30, Sunday to January 6, 2020, 02:00, Monday, with data points recorded at 30-minute intervals\u2019. No\\ndescription is available for this region. Now we want to predict the taxi inflow and outflow for the next 12 time steps during the time\\nperiod of \u2019January 6, 2020, 02:30, Monday to January 6, 2020, 08:00, Monday, with data points recorded at 30-minute intervals\u2019...\\nGround true: Based on the given information, the predictions of taxi inflow and outflow in this region are [9 3 3 4 6 3 30 22 58 74 91\\n110] and[5 10 7 15 11 19 43 46 90 146 213 187] .\\nLlama-2-70b Responds: Based on the provided historical data, I have analyzed the traffic patterns... Taxi Inflow: [105 90 80 70 60 55\\n45 35 25 15 10 5] Taxi Outflow: [95 85 70 60 50 45 35 25 15 10 5 0] . The predictions are based on the following factors...\\nChatGPT Responds: To generate predictions for the next 12 time steps, we can use the average values as a baseline...Predicted taxi\\ninflows: [53.33 53.33... 53.33] . Predicted taxi outflows: [40.83 40.83... 40.83] ...\\nClaude-2.1 Responds: The data covers evening hours on a Sunday and early morning hours on a Monday. We can expect lower taxi\\ndemand during later Sunday evening, with some pickup around end-of-weekend times and early Monday commute times. The region\\nis unspecified, so we cannot infer any location-specific usage patterns. Inflow ranges from 49-111 taxis over the 30 minute intervals.\\nOutflow ranges from 19-100 taxis. This indicates the region likely serves both residential and commercial purposes.\\nPrediction: Inflows: [25 15 10 8 7 9 15 25 35 40 45 50] . Outflows: [40 35 20 12 8 10 20 30 45 50 55 60] ...\\nUrbanGPT Responds: Based on the given information, the predictions (predicted tokens) of taxi inflow and outflow in this region are\\n<ST_PRE> [4 4 2 3 4 13 25 39 56 80 101 117] and <ST_PRE> [6 4 2 2 4 13 24 39 56 80 100 115] .\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': \"I'll analyze this UrbanGPT paper to identify the most relevant 5 references that have GitHub repositories.

This has significant implications in the field\\nof urban computing, where the ability to predict transportation\\npatterns can optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance\\noverall urban mobility [ 18,31]. Moreover, anticipating population\\nmovement can aid in effective urban planning and resource alloca-\\ntion [ 7,20]. Additionally, the ability to forecast crimes can greatly\\ncontribute to enhancing public safety [ 32]. Spatio-temporal predic-\\ntion plays a vital role in shaping smarter and more efficient cities,\\nultimately leading to an improved quality of urban life.\\nIt is important to highlight the various types of neural network\\narchitectures commonly adopted in this domain of spatio-temporal\\nprediction. These architectures are designed to capture and model\\nthe complex relationships between spatial and temporal dimensions\\nin the data. One widely employed architecture is the Convolutional\\nNeural Network (CNN) [ 15,39,45], which is effective in extract-\\ning spatial features by applying convolutional filters across the\\ninput data. Another line of spatio-temporal neural networks is the\\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) family [ 1,34,43]. Those spatio-\\ntemporal RNNs are well-suited for capturing temporal dependencies\\nby maintaining a memory state that can retain information over\\ntime. Recently, there has been a surge in the use of Graph Neural\\nNetworks (GNNs) for spatio-temporal prediction [ 36,40,47]. GNNs\\nexcel in modeling complex spatial relationships in data represented\\nas graphs, where each node corresponds to a spatial location and\\nedges capture the connections between them.\\nWhile current spatio-temporal neural network techniques have\\nproven to be highly effective, it is crucial to acknowledge their\\nstrong dependence on having an abundance of labeled data in order\\nto generate accurate predictions. However, the pervasive problem\\nof data scarcity in practical urban sensing scenarios poses a sig-\\nnificant challenge. For example, deploying sensors throughout the\\nentire urban space to monitor citywide traffic volume or air qual-\\nity is impractical due to the high cost involved [ 17,41]. Moreover,\\nthe challenge of limited labeled data availability extends to spatio-\\ntemporal forecasting across different cities, in which acquiring\\nlabeled data for each target city becomes a daunting task [ 13,38].\\nThese issues emphasize the pressing need for novel solutions that\\naddress data scarcity and enhance the generalization capabilities of\\nspatio-temporal models in various smart city applications.\\nInspired by the remarkable progress of large language models\\n(LLMs), our primary goal is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that\\npossesses outstanding generalization capabilities across a wide\\narray of urban tasks. Leveraging the reasoning abilities inherent in\\nLLMs, we aim to expand their success into the domain of spatio-\\ntemporal analysis. Our objective is to develop a model that can\\neffectively comprehend and forecast intricate spatial and temporal\\npatterns, enabling it to excel in various urban scenarios.\\nWhile it is of utmost importance to develop a versatile spatio-\\ntemporal model capable of effectively handling diverse downstreamarXiv:2403.00813v3  [cs.CL]  19 May 2024\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 2\\n\\nInstruction s:Given thehistorical data fortaxiflow over 12time steps inaspecific region ofNew York City, the\\nrecorded taxiinflows are[9194100 939376676650695542],and therecorded taxioutflows are[9691108\\n10283787674106938657]\u2026Please predict thetaxiinflow and outflow fornext 12time steps\u2026\\nLabel s:Taxi Inflow :[5536333033273714167512]Taxi Outflow :[547069593231292120111312].\\nOurs :Based onthegiven information, thepredictions oftaxiinflow and outflow inthisregion are\u2026\\nPrediction :Inflow :[514845424038332824211816]Outflow :[544945413835302521181614].\\nHuman\\nInstructions\\nLLAMA -70BGround true\\nPrediction :Inflow :[282827262524232323232424]Outflow :[343128252219171616151515] Baseline\\nLLM :There isanoticeable spike intaxiinflows and outflows around 10:00-11:00,which may indicate asurge in\\ndemand fortaxiservices\u2026Ihave created apredictive model toforecast thetaxiflow forthenext 12time steps :\\nPrediction :Inflow :[53586460677378849196102 108]Outflow :[5661687379848995102 107 113 119]\\nUrbanGPT\\n2 4 6 8 10 12\\nTime Steps020406080100 Inflow Predicted valueBaseline\\nLLM\\nOurs\\nGround_true\\n2 4 6 8 10 12\\nTime Steps020406080100120 Outflow Predicted valueBaseline\\nLLM\\nOurs\\nGround_trueFigure 1: The superior predictive performance of the pro-\\nposed UrbanGPT compared to the large language model\\n(LLaMA-70B) and the spatiotemporal graph neural network\\n(STGCN) in a zero-shot traffic flow prediction scenario.\\ntasks, aligning the spatio-temporal context with the knowledge\\nspace of large language models (LLMs) and enabling them to com-\\nprehend the complex dependencies across time and space present\\nsignificant challenges. These hurdles call for meticulous model\\ndesign to bridge the gap between the unique characteristics of\\nspatio-temporal data and the knowledge encoded within LLMs.\\nContributions . In light of these challenges, we propose UrbanGPT,\\na large language model specifically tailored for spatio-temporal\\nprediction. At the core of UrbanGPT lies a novel spatio-temporal\\ninstruction-tuning paradigm that seeks to align the intricate de-\\npendencies of time and space, with the knowledge space of LLMs.\\nWithin our UrbanGPT framework, we start by incorporating a\\nspatio-temporal dependency encoder, which utilizes a multi-level\\ntemporal convolutional network. This encoder enables the model\\nto capture the intricate temporal dynamics present in the spatio-\\ntemporal data across various time resolutions. Then, our model\\ninvolves aligning textual and spatio-temporal information to em-\\npower language models in effectively injecting spatio-temporal\\ncontextual signals. This is achieved through the utilization of a\\nlightweight alignment module that projects the representations\\nof spatio-temporal dependencies. The result is the generation of\\nmore expressive semantic representations by integrating valuable\\ninformation from both textual and spatio-temporal domains.\\nThrough the incorporation of spatio-temporal information dur-\\ning the instruction-tuning process, the language model gains profi-\\nciency in understanding and processing the intricate relationships\\nand patterns found in spatio-temporal data. By leveraging the in-\\nsights obtained from the spatio-temporal domain, the language\\nmodel becomes better equipped to capture the nuances and com-\\nplexities of spatio-temporal phenomena. This, in turn, enables the\\nmodel to make more reliable and insightful predictions across vari-\\nous urban scenarios, even when faced with limited data availability.\\nTo showcase the superior predictive performance of our pro-\\nposed model, we compare it with the large language model (LLaMA-\\n70B) and the spatio-temporal graph neural network (STGCN) in azero-shot traffic flow prediction scenario guided by textual instruc-\\ntions, as depicted in Figure 1. The large language model, LLaMA,\\neffectively infers traffic patterns from the input text. However, its\\nlimitations in handling numeric time-series data with complex spa-\\ntial and temporal dependencies can sometimes lead to opposite\\ntraffic trend predictions. On the other hand, the pre-trained base-\\nline model demonstrates a strong understanding of spatio-temporal\\ndependencies. However, it may suffer from overfitting to the source\\ndataset and underperform in zero-shot scenarios, indicating its lim-\\nited generalization capabilities beyond existing spatio-temporal\\nprediction models. In contrast, our proposed model achieves a har-\\nmonious integration of domain-specific spatio-temporal knowledge\\nand language modeling capabilities. This enables us to make more\\naccurate and reliable predictions under data scarcity.\\nIn summary, our main contributions can be outlined as follows:\\n\u2022To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop\\na spatio-temporal large language model capable of predicting\\ndiverse urban phenomena across different datasets, especially\\nunder conditions of limited data availability.\\n\u2022We propose UrbanGPT, a spatio-temporal prediction framework\\nthat empowers large language models (LLMs) to comprehend\\nthe intricate inter-dependencies across time and space. This is\\nachieved through the seamless integration of a spatio-temporal\\ndependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm, ef-\\nfectively aligning the spatio-temporal context with LLMs.\\n\u2022Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets\\nprovide compelling evidence of our proposed UrbanGPT\u2019s excep-\\ntional ability to generalize in zero-shot spatio-temporal learning\\nscenarios. These findings highlight the model\u2019s robust general-\\nization capacity, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately\\npredicting and understanding spatio-temporal patterns, even in\\nscenarios where no prior training data is available.\\n2 PRELIMINARIES\\nSpatio-Temporal Data . Spatio-temporal data is commonly col-\\nlected and can be represented as a three-dimensional tensor X\u2208\\nR\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc47\u00d7\ud835\udc39. Each element X\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udc53in the tensor corresponds to the value\\nof the\ud835\udc53-th feature at the \ud835\udc61-th time interval in the \ud835\udc5f-th region. To\\nprovide an example, let\u2019s consider predicting taxi traffic patterns in\\nan urban area. In this scenario, the data can represent the inflow\\nand outflow of taxis in a specific region ( e.g., the\ud835\udc5f-th spatial area)\\nduring a given time period from \ud835\udc61to\ud835\udc61\u22121(e.g., a 30-minute interval).\\nSpatio-Temporal Forecasting. In spatio-temporal prediction tasks,\\na common scenario involves forecasting future trends using histor-\\nical data. Specifically, the goal is to predict the data for the next \ud835\udc43\\ntime steps based on information from the preceding \ud835\udc3bsteps.\\nX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+\ud835\udc43=\ud835\udc53(X\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e\u2212\ud835\udc3b+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e) (1)\\nThe function \ud835\udc53(\u00b7)represents a spatio-temporal prediction model\\nthat has been trained effectively using historical data. Spatio-temporal\\nprediction tasks can be divided into two main categories: regression\\nprediction, which involves predicting continuous values like traffic\\nflow or taxi demand [ 22], and classification prediction, where the\\ngoal is to classify events such as crime occurrence prediction [ 11].\\nTo optimize the model \ud835\udc53(\u00b7), different loss functions are utilized\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 3\\n\\nbased on the specific characteristics of the spatio-temporal scenar-\\nios.\\nSpatio-Temporal Zero-Shot Learning . Despite the effectiveness\\nof current spatio-temporal learning approaches, they often en-\\ncounter difficulties in effectively generalizing across a wide range of\\ndownstream spatio-temporal learning scenarios. In this study, our\\nfocus is on addressing the challenge of spatio-temporal zero-shot\\nscenarios, where we aim to learn from previously unseen data in\\ndownstream spatio-temporal prediction datasets or tasks. This can\\nbe formally defined as follows:\\n\u02dcX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+\ud835\udc43=\u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u02dcX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e\u2212\ud835\udc3b+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e) (2)\\nIn this particular scenario, the prediction function \u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u00b7)is responsi-\\nble for forecasting the spatio-temporal data \u02dcXfrom downstream\\ntasks that have not been previously encountered. It should be noted\\nthat the model \u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u00b7)is not trained specifically on the target data.\\n3 METHODOLOGY\\n3.1 Spatio-Temporal Dependency Encoder\\nAlthough large language models demonstrate exceptional profi-\\nciency in language processing, they face challenges in comprehend-\\ning the time-evolving patterns inherent in spatio-temporal data. To\\novercome this limitation, we propose enhancing the capability of\\nlarge language models to capture temporal dependencies within\\nspatio-temporal contexts. This is accomplished by integrating a\\nspatio-temporal encoder that incorporates a multi-level tempo-\\nral convolutional network. By doing so, we enable the model to\\neffectively capture the intricate temporal dependencies across vari-\\nous time resolutions, thereby improving its understanding of the\\ncomplex temporal dynamics present in the spatio-temporal data.\\nSpecifically, our spatio-temporal encoder is composed of two key\\ncomponents: a gated dilated convolution layer and a multi-level\\ncorrelation injection layer. Let\u2019s formalize this architecture as:\\n\u03a8(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f=(\u00afW(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc58\u2217E(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+\u00afb(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc58)\u00b7\ud835\udeff(\u00afW(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc54\u2217E(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+\u00afb(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc54)+E\u2032(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f (3)\\nWe begin with the initial spatio-temporal embedding, denoted as\\nE\ud835\udc5f\u2208R\ud835\udc47\u00d7\ud835\udc51. This embedding is obtained by enhancing the original\\ndata Xthrough a linear layer. To address the issue of gradient\\nvanishing, we utilize a slice of E\ud835\udc5f, denoted as E\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5f\u2208R\ud835\udc47\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51, which\\nis determined by the size of the dilated convolutional kernel. This\\nslice is employed for performing residual operations. To perform\\nthe residual operations, we use 1-D dilated convolution kernels\\n\u00afW\ud835\udc58and \u00afW\ud835\udc54\u2208R\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc54\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61, along with the corresponding bias\\nterms \u00afb\ud835\udc58and \u00afb\ud835\udc54\u2208R\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61. The sigmoid activation function \ud835\udeffis\\napplied to control the degree of information preservation during the\\nrepeated convolution operation. After the gated temporal dilated\\nconvolutional layer encoding, we are able to effectively capture the\\ntemporal dependencies across multiple time steps, resulting in the\\ngeneration of temporal representations.\\nThese representations contain different levels of temporal de-\\npendencies, reflecting various granularity-aware time-evolving pat-\\nterns. To preserve these informative patterns, we introduce a multi-\\nlevel correlation injection layer. This layer is designed to incorpo-\\nrate correlations between different levels and is formalized as:\\nS(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f=(W(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc60\u2217\u03a8(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+b(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc60)+S(\ud835\udc59\u22121)\\n\ud835\udc5f (4)We have the convolution kernel W\ud835\udc60\u2208R\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc46\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\u00d7\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61and the bias\\nvector b\ud835\udc60\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61. These are employed after \ud835\udc3flayers of encoding.\\nA simple non-linear layer is employed to merge the results from\\nequations 3 and 4, and the final spatio-temporal dependency repre-\\nsentations of are denoted as \u02dc\u03a8\u2208R\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc39\u00d7\ud835\udc51. To address the diverse\\nset of urban scenarios that may arise downstream, our proposed\\nspatio-temporal encoder is designed to be independent of graph\\nstructures when modeling spatial correlations. This is particularly\\ncrucial because in zero-shot prediction contexts, the spatial rela-\\ntionships between entities may be unknown or difficult to ascertain.\\nBy not relying on explicit graph structures, our encoder can effec-\\ntively handle a broad spectrum of urban scenarios, where spatial\\ncorrelations and dependencies can vary or be challenging to define\\nin advance. This flexibility enables our model to adapt and perform\\nwell, ensuring its applicability in a wide range of urban contexts.\\n3.2 Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning\\n3.2.1 Spatio-Temporal-Text Alignment. In order to enable lan-\\nguage models to effectively comprehend spatio-temporal patterns,\\nit is crucial to align textual and spatio-temporal information. This\\nalignment allows for the fusion of different modalities, resulting\\nin a more informative representation. By integrating contextual\\nfeatures from both textual and spatio-temporal domains, we can\\ncapture complementary information and extract higher-level se-\\nmantic representations that are more expressive and meaningful.\\nTo achieve this objective, we utilize a lightweight alignment mod-\\nule to project the spatio-temporal dependencies representations\\n\u02dc\u03a8. This projection involves the use of parameters W\ud835\udc5d\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f\\nandb\ud835\udc5d\u2208R\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, where\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3frepresents the commonly used hidden\\ndimension in language models (LLMs).\\nThe resulting projection, denoted as H\u2208R\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc39\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, are rep-\\nresented in the instructions using special tokens as: <ST_start>,\\n<ST_HIS>, ..., <ST_HIS>, <ST_end>. Here, <ST_start> and <ST_end>\\nserve as identifiers marking the beginning and end of the spatio-\\ntemporal token. These identifiers can be included in the large-\\nscale language model by expanding its vocabulary. The placeholder\\n<ST_HIS> represents the spatio-temporal token and corresponds to\\nthe projection Hin the hidden layer. By employing this technique,\\nthe model gains the ability to discern spatio-temporal dependen-\\ncies, thereby enhancing its proficiency in successfully performing\\nspatio-temporal predictive tasks within urban scenes.\\n3.2.2 Spatio-Temporal Prompt Instructions. In scenarios in-\\nvolving spatio-temporal prediction, both temporal and spatial in-\\nformation contain valuable semantic details that contribute to the\\nmodel\u2019s understanding of spatio-temporal patterns within specific\\ncontexts. For instance, traffic flow in the early morning differs sig-\\nnificantly from rush hour, and there are variations in traffic patterns\\nbetween commercial and residential areas. As a result, we recognize\\nthe potential of representing both temporal and spatial information\\nas prompt instruction text. We leverage the text understanding\\ncapabilities of large language models to encode this information,\\nenabling associative reasoning for downstream tasks.\\nIn our UrbanGPT framework, we integrate multi-granularity\\ntime information and spatial details as instruction inputs for the\\nlarge language model. Time information includes factors such as\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 4\\n\\nl = 1l = 2l = 3\\nGateSpatio -Temporal dependenc yencoder\\nLLMs spaceLightweight alignment moduleSpatio -Temporal Instruction -Tuning\\nGiven the historical data and the corresponding tokens\\n<ST_HIS> fortaxi flow \u2026The recording time \u2026This region\\nislocated \u2026Please generate thepredictive tokens for\u2026\\nBased onthe given information, the predictive tokens\\noftaxi inflow and outflow inthis region are<ST_PRE> \u2026\\nLarge Language Models\\nInflow\uff1a[28 26 20 33 49  50 48 34 40 22 \u2026]\\nOutflow\uff1a[40 52 58 32 22 10 18 19 20 24\u2026]City A\\nCity B\\n\u2026\\nInstruction -Tuning Zero -shot prediction\\n<ST_HIS> <ST_HIS> Multi -tasks\\nRegression Layer<ST_HIS> <ST_ PRE> \\ntokens\\nText Replacement\\nLlama VicunaAlignment\\nRegressionST Encoder\\nTask assignment\\nText instructionsInstructions\\nResponsesRegion A\\nRegion B\\nFrozen Trainable\\n\u2026\\nSpatio -Temporal Zero -shot prediction\\nTrain city\\nTest cityTrain region\\nTest region\\nST dependency representations ST Instruction -Tuning of LLMsFigure 2: The overall architecture of the proposed spatio-temporal language model UrbanGPT.\\nTemporal Information :The recording time ofthehistorical data is'January 7,2020 ,08:30,\\nTuesday toJanuary 7,2020 ,14:00,Tuesday, with data points recorded at30-minute intervals' .\\nSpatial Information :Here istheregion information :This region islocated within theStaten\\nIsland borough district and encompasses various POIs within athree -kilometer radius,\\ncovering Public Safety, Education Facility, Residential categories .\\nTask description :Now wewant topredict thetaxi inflow and outflow forthenext 12time\\nsteps during thetime period of'January 7,2020 ,14:30,Tuesday toJanuary 7,2020 ,20:00,\\nTuesday, with data points recorded at30-minute intervals' .\\nFigure 3: Illustration of spatio-temporal prompt instructions\\nencoding the time- and location-aware information.\\nthe day of the week and the hour of the day, while regional in-\\nformation encompasses the city, administrative areas, and nearby\\npoints of interest (POI) data, among others. By incorporating these\\ndiverse elements, UrbanGPT is capable of identifying and assimi-\\nlating spatio-temporal patterns across different regions and time-\\nframes. This enables the model to encapsulate these insights within\\ncomplex spatio-temporal contexts, thereby enhancing its ability\\nfor zero-shot reasoning. The design of the instructional text for\\nspatio-temporal information is illustrated in Figure 3.\\n3.2.3 Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning of LLMs. When\\nit comes to incorporating detailed spatio-temporal textual descrip-\\ntions, the next stage is to fine-tune large language models (LLMs)\\nusing instructions to generate spatio-temporal forecasts in textual\\nformat. However, this approach poses two challenges. Firstly , spatio-\\ntemporal forecasting typically relies on numerical data, which dif-\\nfers in structure and patterns from natural language that language\\nmodels excel at processing, focusing on semantic and syntactic rela-\\ntionships. Secondly , large language models are typically pre-trained\\nusing a multi-classification loss to predict vocabulary, resulting in a\\nprobability distribution of potential outcomes. This contrasts with\\nthe continuous value distribution required for regression tasks.\\nTo address these challenges, UrbanGPT adopts a different strat-\\negy by refraining from directly predicting future spatio-temporal\\nvalues. Instead, it generates forecasting tokens that aid in the pre-\\ndiction process. These tokens are subsequently passed through a\\nregression layer, which maps the hidden representations to generate\\nmore accurate predictive values. The formulation of the regressionlayer in our spatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm is:\\n\u02c6Y\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53=W3[\ud835\udf0e(W1H\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53),\ud835\udf0e(W2\u0393\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53)] (5)\\nThe prediction result, denoted as \u02c6Y\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53\u2208R\ud835\udc43, is obtained using the\\nrectified linear unit activation function, represented by \ud835\udf0e. The hid-\\nden representations of the forecasting tokens, denoted as \u0393\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53\u2208\\nR\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, are introduced as a novel term in the vocabulary of large lan-\\nguage models (LLMs). The regression layer is formulated using\\nweight matrices W1\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f,W2\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, and W3\u2208R\ud835\udc43\u00d72\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n,\\nwhere[\u00b7,\u00b7]represents the concatenation operation. While the prob-\\nability distribution of the forecasting tokens remains relatively\\nstable, their hidden representations contain rich spatio-temporal\\ncontextual attributes that capture dynamic spatio-temporal interde-\\npendencies. This enables our model to provide precise predictions\\nby leveraging this contextual information.\\n3.3 Model Optimization\\nBuilding upon the baseline model [ 1,8], we adopt the absolute error\\nloss as our regression loss function. This choice allows us to effec-\\ntively handle predictions across a wide range of urban scenarios.\\nAdditionally, we introduce a classification loss as a joint loss to\\ncater to diverse task requirements. To ensure optimal performance,\\nour model optimizes different losses based on the specific task in-\\nputs. For instance, we utilize the regression loss for tasks such as\\ntraffic flow prediction, while employing the classification loss for\\ntasks like crime prediction. This approach enables our model to\\neffectively address the unique challenges posed by each task and\\ndeliver accurate predictions in various urban scenarios.\\nL\ud835\udc50=\u22121\\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01\\n\ud835\udc56=1[\ud835\udeff(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)\u00b7log(\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)+(1\u2212\ud835\udeff(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56))\u00b7log(1\u2212\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)]\\nL\ud835\udc5f=1\\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01\\n\ud835\udc56=1|\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\u2212\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56|;L=L\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc60+L\ud835\udc5f+L\ud835\udc50 (6)\\nHere,\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56represents a sample from \u02c6Y, and\ud835\udc41represents the total\\nnumber of samples, which is calculated as the product of \ud835\udc45,\ud835\udc47, and\\n\ud835\udc39. We use various loss functions in our model, including L\ud835\udc50for\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 5\\n\\nbinary cross-entropy loss, L\ud835\udc5ffor regression loss, and the cross-\\nentropy loss adopted in our spatio-temporal language models. To\\ncapture probability distributions from the prediction, we employ\\nthe sigmoid function denoted by \ud835\udeff. Each of these loss functions\\nplays a specific role in our model, allowing us to effectively handle\\nclassification, regression, and language modeling tasks as needed.\\n4 EVALUATION\\nIn this section, we aim to assess the capabilities of our proposed\\nmodel across various settings by addressing five key questions:\\n\u2022RQ1 : What is the performance and generalization capability of\\nUrbanGPT in diverse zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction tasks?\\n\u2022RQ2 : How does UrbanGPT perform when compared to existing\\nspatio-temporal models in classical supervised scenarios?\\n\u2022RQ3 : What specific contributions do the proposed key compo-\\nnents bring to enhance the capabilities of our UrbanGPT model?\\n\u2022RQ4 : Can the proposed model robustly handle the forecasting\\nscenarios with varying spatio-temporal patterns?\\n4.1 Experimental Setting\\n4.1.1 Dataset Description. To evaluate the effectiveness of the\\nproposed model in predicting spatio-temporal patterns across var-\\nious urban computing scenarios, we conducted experiments us-\\ning four distinct datasets: NYC-taxi, NYC-bike, NYC-crime, and\\nCHI-taxi. These datasets encompass a wide range of data sources\\nto capture the dynamic nature of urban environments, including\\nrecords of taxi travel, bike trajectories, crime incidents in New York\\nCity, and taxi travel data in Chicago. To facilitate our analysis, we\\npartitioned the cities into grid-like regions based on latitude and\\nlongitude information. Within specific time intervals, we aggre-\\ngated statistical measures for each region. For example, this in-\\nvolved calculating the number of taxi inflows and outflows within\\na 30-minute period in region A, or determining the count of theft\\nincidents within a day in region B. Furthermore, Points of Interest\\n(POIs) data can be obtained through APIs provided by map services,\\nutilizing the latitude and longitude of different regions. For more\\ncomprehensive data descriptions, please refer to the Appendix.\\n4.1.2 Evaluation Protocols. In order to investigate the capabili-\\nties of large language models in analyzing diverse spatio-temporal\\ndata across different regions, we selected a subset of taxi, bike, and\\ncrime data from various areas of New York City as our training set.\\n\u2022Zero-Shot Learning Scenarios . We assessed the model perfor-\\nmance by predicting future spatio-temporal data from regions in\\nNYC or even Chicago that were unseen in the training phase.\\n\u2022Supervised Learning Scenarios . We evaluated the model using\\nfuture data from the same regions as the training set.\\nFor regression tasks, we maintained a consistent training and test-\\ning methodology across all baseline models. When it came to classi-\\nfication tasks involving crime data, we utilized binary cross-entropy\\nas the loss function for training and testing the models. Our ex-\\nperiments were conducted using the robust vicuna-7b [ 50] as the\\nfoundational large language model for UrbanGPT. For a more com-\\nprehensive understanding of our methodology and experimental\\nsetup, please refer to the appendix for detailed information.4.1.3 Evaluation Metrics. For regression tasks, we employed\\nMAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)\\nas evaluation metrics. These metrics quantify the discrepancies\\nbetween the predicted outcomes and the actual labels, with lower\\nvalues indicating superior performance [ 12,49]. In the case of clas-\\nsification tasks, we utilized Recall and Macro-F1 as evaluation met-\\nrics to assess performance. Recall measures the model\u2019s ability to\\ncorrectly identify positive instances, while Macro-F1 is a compre-\\nhensive performance metric that combines precision and recall to\\nprovide an overall measure of classification accuracy [11, 30].\\n4.1.4 Baseline Model. We conducted a thorough comparison\\nwith 10 advanced models to establish baselines for our proposed\\nmethod. (i)In the category of RNNs-based spatio-temporal forecast-\\ning methods, we compared our proposed method with AGCRN [ 1],\\nDMVSTNET [ 39] and ST-LSTM [ 33]. These approaches leverage\\nRNNs for modeling and prediction. (ii)The GNNs-based spatio-\\ntemporal models primarily utilize graph neural networks to cap-\\nture spatial correlations and integrate temporal encoders to capture\\nspatio-temporal relationships. The models we compared against\\nin this category include GWN [ 37], MTGNN [ 36], STSGCN [ 26],\\nTGCN [ 47], and STGCN [ 42].(iii) In the attention-based spatio-\\ntemporal models category, the methods employ attention mecha-\\nnisms to model spatio-temporal correlations. The models we com-\\npared against in this category are ASTGCN [8] and STWA [5].\\n4.2 Zero-Shot Prediction Performance (RQ1)\\nIn this section, we thoroughly evaluate the predictive performance\\nof our proposed model in zero-shot scenarios. The results of our\\nevaluation are presented in Table 1 and visualized in Figure 4. Our\\nobjective is to assess the model\u2019s effectiveness in predicting spatio-\\ntemporal patterns in geographical areas that it has not encountered\\nduring training. This evaluation encompasses both cross-region\\nand cross-city settings, allowing us to gain insights into the model\u2019s\\ngeneralization capabilities across different locations.\\n4.2.1 Prediction on Unseen Regions within a City. Cross-\\nregion scenarios entail using data from certain regions within a\\ncity to forecast future conditions in other regions that have not\\nbeen encountered by the model. Through a thorough analysis of\\nthe model\u2019s performance in these cross-region predictions, we can\\ndraw attention to three significant observations:\\ni) Superior Zero-shot Predictive Performance . The results pre-\\nsented in Table 1 highlight the exceptional performance of our\\nproposed model in both regression and classification tasks on vari-\\nous datasets, surpassing the baseline models in zero-shot prediction.\\nThe success of our model can be attributed to two key factors.\\n\u2022Spatio-Temporal-Text-Alignment . The alignment of spatio-\\ntemporal contextual signals with the text comprehension abil-\\nities of language models plays a pivotal role in the success of\\nour proposed model. This fusion enables the model to effectively\\ncapitalize on both the encoded urban dynamics from the spa-\\ntiotemporal signals and the comprehensive understanding of\\ntextual context provided by the LLMs. By leveraging these two\\nessential aspects, our model achieves the remarkable ability to\\ngeneralize its prediction capabilities in zero-shot scenarios.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 6\\n\\nTable 1: Our model\u2019s performance in zero-shot prediction is evaluated on three diverse datasets: NYC-taxi, NYC-bike, and\\nNYC-crime, providing a comprehensive assessment of its predictive capabilities in unseen situations.\\nModelDataset NYC-taxi NYC-bike NYC-crime\\nType Inflow Outflow Inflow Outflow Burglary Robbery\\nMetrics MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE Macro-F1 Recall Macro-F1 Recall\\nAGCRN 10.86 26.51 13.15 36.45 3.41 7.98 3.42 8.08 0.48 0.00 0.49 0.01\\nASTGCN 9.75 24.12 12.42 33.28 5.58 11.58 5.78 12.29 0.49 0.01 0.55 0.09\\nGWN 10.73 26.50 9.67 26.74 3.32 8.17 3.07 7.52 0.48 0.00 0.52 0.04\\nMTGNN 10.16 25.84 12.59 35.38 3.18 7.62 3.20 7.65 0.64 0.27 0.65 0.30\\nSTWA 11.28 28.97 13.54 38.61 4.59 10.94 4.35 10.67 0.48 0.00 0.51 0.03\\nSTSGCN 18.97 41.38 20.07 45.79 6.85 14.98 6.54 14.77 0.48 0.00 0.48 0.00\\nSTGCN 12.54 30.80 14.32 39.58 4.11 9.21 4.45 9.62 0.48 0.00 0.64 0.30\\nTGCN 10.04 25.10 10.98 30.03 2.88 6.55 2.91 6.42 0.56 0.10 0.58 0.13\\nDMVSTNET 11.00 28.29 10.59 29.20 3.80 9.87 3.65 9.21 0.48 0.01 0.59 0.15\\nST-LSTM 16.97 34.43 18.93 44.10 7.78 15.41 6.92 17.12 0.48 0.00 0.49 0.03\\nUrbanGPT 6.16 16.92 6.83 21.78 2.02 5.16 2.01 5.03 0.67 0.34 0.69 0.42\\n\u2022Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning . This adaptive tuning\\nprocess empowers the LLM to effectively integrate crucial in-\\nformation from the instructions, enhancing its comprehension\\nof the complex relationships and dependencies between spatial\\nand temporal factors. By seamlessly merging the spatio-temporal\\ninstruction-tuning with the spatio-temporal dependency encoder,\\nour proposed model, UrbanGPT, successfully preserves universal\\nand transferable spatio-temporal knowledge. Consequently, the\\nmodel becomes capable of capturing the fundamental patterns\\nand dynamics that govern spatio-temporal phenomena, enabling\\nit to make precise predictions in downstream zero-shot scenarios.\\nii) Enhanced Urban Semantic Understanding . Urban seman-\\ntics offer valuable insights into the diverse dimensions of spatial\\nand temporal characteristics. Our approach involves training our\\nmodel on a wide range of datasets, enriching its understanding\\nof spatio-temporal dynamics across different timeframes and geo-\\ngraphical locations. In contrast, baseline models tend to prioritize\\nencoding temporal and spatial dependencies, neglecting the nu-\\nanced semantics that differentiate regions, timeframes, and data\\ncategories. By incorporating comprehensive semantic awareness\\ninto our UrbanGPT, we significantly enhance its ability to make\\naccurate zero-shot predictions in previously unseen regions.\\niii) Improved Performance in Sparse Data Scenarios . Predict-\\ning spatio-temporal patterns in sparse data environments is chal-\\nlenging as models tend to overfit when data points are scarce. This\\nchallenge is particularly notable when predicting crimes, where data\\nis often sparse but crucial for accurate predictions. Baseline mod-\\nels struggle in cross-regional prediction tasks under these sparse\\nconditions, resulting in low recall scores that indicate potential over-\\nfitting. To overcome this limitation, our model integrates spatio-\\ntemporal learning with large language models (LLMs) using an\\neffective spatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm. By incorpo-\\nrating rich semantic insights, our approach enhances the model\u2019s\\nspatio-temporal representations, enabling it to effectively handle\\nsparse data and achieve improved prediction accuracy.\\n4.2.2 Cross-City Prediction Task. To assess the performance of\\nour model in cross-city prediction tasks, we conducted tests on the\\nCHI-taxi dataset, which was not seen during the training phase. The\\nresults, depicted in Figure 4, yielded the following observations:\u2022Consistency in Multi-step Prediction : Our model consistently\\noutperforms the comparison method at each time step. Notably,\\nit maintains a significant advantage in both short-term and long-\\nterm spatio-temporal prediction, demonstrating the robustness\\nof our proposed model in cross-city prediction scenarios.\\n\u2022Effective Knowledge Transfer Across Cities : The prediction\\nresults obtained from the CHI-taxi dataset validate the supe-\\nrior forecasting capabilities of our model in cross-city scenarios.\\nThis enhancement can be attributed to the integration of spatio-\\ntemporal encoders with the spatio-temporal instruction-tuning\\nparadigm. By incorporating these components, our model ef-\\nfectively captures universal and transferable spatio-temporal\\npatterns, allowing it to make accurate predictions. Additionally,\\nby considering different geographical information and temporal\\nfactors alongside the learned transferred knowledge, our model\\nsuccessfully associates spatio-temporal patterns exhibited by\\nsimilar functional areas and historical periods. This comprehen-\\nsive understanding provides valuable insights for making precise\\nzero-shot predictions in cross-city scenarios.\\n4.3 Classical Supervised Prediction Task (RQ2)\\nThis section examines the predictive capabilities of our UrbanGPT\\nin end-to-end supervised prediction scenarios, as presented in Ta-\\nble 2. We will discuss the results from two perspectives below.\\nEnhanced Long-Term Forecasting Abilities : We examined the\\nmodel\u2019s effectiveness in long-term spatio-temporal forecasting by\\nutilizing test datasets that spanned broader time intervals. For in-\\nstance, we trained the model using data from 2017 and evaluated its\\nperformance on data from 2021.

Models lacking dedi-\\ncated spatial correlation modules, like LSTM, tend to underperform\\nas they overlook the spatial context. In contrast, our model com-\\npensates for the absence of explicit spatial encoders by integrating\\nextensive geographic and points of interest (POIs) data within the\\ntextual input. This approach enables the model to comprehend the\\nshared characteristics of areas with similar functions at a higher\\nsemantic level. Consequently, it deduces patterns of correlation\\nbetween various functional zones and effectively represents the\\ninterconnections among different regions.\\n4.4 Ablation study (RQ3)\\nThis section investigates the impact of different key components\\non the performance of our model, as illustrated in Figure 5. Our\\nrigorous testing primarily revolves around the zero-shot scenario\\nusing the NYC-taxi dataset. Through our analysis, we have distilled\\nthe benefits offered by the different modules into four key points.\\n\u2022(1) Impact of Spatial and Temporal Context :-STC . By re-\\nmoving time and spatial information from the instruction text,\\nwe observed a noticeable decline in the model\u2019s performance.\\nThis can be attributed to the lack of temporal information, forcing\\nthe model to rely solely on spatio-temporal encoders for encoding\\ntime-related features and performing prediction tasks. Furthermore,\\nthe absence of spatial information hindered the model\u2019s ability to\\ncapture spatial correlations, making it challenging to analyze the\\ndistinct spatio-temporal patterns of different areas.\\n\u2022(2) Impact of Instruction-Tuning with Diverse Datasets :-\\nMulti . We conducted our training solely on the NYC-taxi data to\\nexamine whether incorporating multiple datasets would provide\\nvaluable insights to the LLMs in zero-shot scenarios.\\n-STC -Multi -STE Ours -T2P\\nNYC-taxi inflow6.06.26.46.66.87.0 MAE\\nNYC-taxi inflow16.817.217.618.0 RMSE\\nNYC-taxi outflow6.66.87.07.27.47.67.88.0 MAE\\nNYC-taxi outflow21.522.022.523.023.524.024.5 RMSEFigure 5: Ablation study of our proposed UrbanGPT.\\nHowever, this restricted training approach limited the model\u2019s\\nability to fully uncover the spatio-temporal dynamics of cities due to\\nthe absence of diverse urban indicators. As a result, the model\u2019s per-\\nformance was suboptimal. By integrating diverse spatio-temporal\\ndata from multiple sources, our model can effectively capture the\\nunique characteristics of different geographical locations and their\\nevolving spatio-temporal patterns.\\n\u2022(3) Impact of Spatio-Temporal Encoder :-STE . In this vari-\\nant, we disable the spatio-temporal encoder to investigate its\\neffect on aligning the large language model with encoded urban\\ndependency dynamics into latent embedding space.\\nThe results clearly indicate that the absence of the spatio-temporal\\nencoder significantly hampers the performance of the large lan-\\nguage model in spatio-temporal prediction scenarios. This under-\\nscores the crucial role played by the proposed spatio-temporal\\nencoder in enhancing the model\u2019s predictive capabilities.\\n\u2022(4) Regression Layer Incorporation in Instruction-Tuning:\\nT2P. We explicitly instructed UrbanGPT to generate its predic-\\ntions in a textual format. However, the suboptimal performance\\nindicates the challenges in utilizing LLMs for precise numerical\\nregression tasks, as opposed to employing regression layers.\\nThe primary challenge stems from the model\u2019s dependence on\\nmulti-class loss for optimization during training, leading to a mis-\\nmatch between the model\u2019s probabilistic output and the continuous\\nvalue distribution necessary for spatio-temporal forecasting. To\\nbridge this gap, we incorporated a regression predictor into our\\nmodel, significantly improving its capacity to generate more precise\\nnumerical predictions for regression tasks.\\n4.5 Model Robustness Study (RQ4)\\nIn this section, we focus on evaluating the robustness of our Ur-\\nbanGPT across different spatio-temporal pattern scenarios. We cate-\\ngorize regions based on the magnitude of numerical variations, such\\nas taxi flow, during a specific time period. Lower variance indicates\\nstable temporal patterns, while higher variance suggests diverse\\nspatio-temporal patterns in active commercial zones or densely\\npopulated areas.

Deep spatio-temporal\\nprediction methods have gained prominence in deep learning due\\nto their impressive performance. These models typically consist of\\ntwo components: temporal dependency modeling and spatial corre-\\nlation encoding. Early models like D-LSTM [ 43] and ST-resnet [ 45]\\nused RNNs and convolutional networks to model temporal and\\nspatial dependencies. Graph neural networks (GNNs) proved to\\nbe a natural fit for spatial correlation modeling, as seen in models\\nlike STGCN [ 42] and DCRNN [ 14], which utilized graph structures\\nbased on node distances. Techniques such as learnable region-wise\\ngraph structures [ 36,37] and dynamic spatio-temporal graph net-\\nworks [9, 48] have further enhanced spatial correlation modeling.\\nFurthermore, researchers have explored approaches such as\\nmulti-scale temporal learning [ 34] and multi-granularity tempo-\\nral learning [ 8] to encode temporal dependencies. These strategies\\nenable the capture of features like long-term and short-term correla-\\ntions as well as periodicity. These advancements have significantlycontributed to the progress of spatio-temporal prediction. However,\\nit is worth noting that the majority of these studies are tailored\\nfor supervised contexts, with limited research and development\\nfocused on zero-shot spatio-temporal forecasting. This represents\\nan important area that requires further exploration.\\nSpatio-Temporal Pre-training . Spatio-temporal pre-training tech-\\nniques have recently received significant research attention. These\\ntechniques primarily focus on generative [ 16,24] and contrastive [ 46]\\npre-training models to enhance the predictive performance of down-\\nstream tasks. There has also been extensive exploration of pretrain-\\nfinetune frameworks for few-shot learning scenarios [ 13,19], aim-\\ning to improve knowledge transferability by aligning source and\\ntarget data. However, these approaches require training or fine-\\ntuning on target data and lack zero-shot prediction capabilities. In\\nthis work, we address the challenge of data scarcity in downstream\\nurban scenarios by proposing UrbanGPT. Our model demonstrates\\nthe ability to generalize well across various scenarios, mitigating\\nthe need for extensive training or fine-tuning on target data.\\nLarge Language Models. The emergence of large language mod-\\nels [3,21] has recently attracted significant attention due to their\\nunprecedented machine performance in tasks like text understand-\\ning and reasoning. These models have become a hot topic, demon-\\nstrating the potential to advance from intelligent algorithms to\\nartificial intelligence. Open-source large language models such as\\nLlama [ 28,29], Vicuna [ 50], and ChatGLM [ 44] have been released,\\nleading to researchers exploring their application in various fields\\nto enhance transfer learning capabilities with domain knowledge\\nfrom these models. In the computer vision domain, researchers\\nhave combined multimodal large language models with prompt\\nlearning methods to achieve zero-shot predictions in downstream\\ntasks [ 25,51,52]. Furthermore, the capabilities of LLMs in graph\\nreasoning [ 2,4,27], recommendation [ 10,23,35] and traffic anal-\\nysis [ 6] have been extensively studied. However, the utilization\\nof large language models for zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction\\ntasks in the field of urban intelligence remains largely unexplored.\\n6 CONCLUSION\\nWe present the UrbanGPT, a spatio-temporal large language model,\\nto generalize well in diverse urban scenarios. To seamlessly align\\nthe spatio-temporal contextual signals with LLMs, we introduce a\\nspatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm. This empowers the\\nUrbanGPT with the remarkable ability to learn universal and trans-\\nferable spatio-temporal patterns across various types of urban data.\\nThrough extensive experiments and meticulous ablation studies,\\nwe demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of the UrbanGPT\u2019s\\narchitecture and its key components. However, it is important to\\nacknowledge that while the results are promising, there are still\\nlimitations to be addressed in future studies. As a first step, we are\\nactively engaged in collecting a more diverse range of urban data\\nto enhance and refine the capabilities of our UrbanGPT across a\\nbroader spectrum of urban computing domains. Additionally, un-\\nderstanding the decision-making process of our UrbanGPT is of im-\\nportance. While the model demonstrates exceptional performance,\\nproviding interpretability and explainability is equally essential.\\nFuture research efforts will focus on empowering our model with\\nthe ability to interpret and explain its predictions.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 9\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n[1]Lei Bai, Lina Yao, Can Li, Xianzhi Wang, and Can Wang. 2020.

The parameters for the di-\\nlation convolution kernel in the time encoder are set as follows:\\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b,\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61, and\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61are all set to 32, with a dilation factor of 1. For\\nour prediction task, we aim to predict the next 12 steps of data\\nbased on the previous 12 steps. Both the history length ( \ud835\udc3b) and\\nprediction length ( \ud835\udc43) are set to 12. The projection layer parameters\\nare configured with \ud835\udc51set to 64 and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3fset to 4096. Lastly, the hidden\\nlayer parameter \ud835\udc51\u2032for the regression layer is set to 128.\\nA.1.3 Further Experimental Setup Descriptions. During the\\ninstruction-tuning phase, we randomly selected 80 regions from\\nthe three datasets in New York City as training data. It\u2019s important\\nto note that the region indices were kept consistent for the NYC-\\nbike and NYC-crime datasets. The training sets had specific time\\nintervals: for NYC-taxi datasets, it ranged from January 1, 2017,\\nto March 31, 2017; for NYC-bike datasets, it covered April 1, 2017,\\nto June 30, 2017; and for NYC-crime datasets, it spanned from\\nJanuary 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018. For the pretraining of the\\nspatio-temporal dependency encoder and the baseline models, we\\nutilized the same data for training to optimize the parameters. The\\nmaximum epoch count was set at 100. In the testing phase, we\\nconducted the following evaluations:\\n\u2022(i)Zero-Shot Prediction . We also selected an additional 80\\nregions from the New York City datasets as unseen test data. For\\nthe NYC-bike and NYC-taxi datasets, we used the first two weeks\\nof data in 2020 for testing. As for the NYC-crime dataset, we used\\nthe entire year of 2020 for testing. In the case of the Chicago city\\ndataset, we evaluated the model using all the data from Dec 2021.\\n\u2022(ii)Classical Supervised Prediction : For evaluation purposes,\\nwe chose the data with the longest time interval, which involved\\ntesting the model using all the data from the NYC-bike and NYC-\\ntaxi datasets specifically for the month of December 2021.\\nA.1.4 Baseline Details. To facilitate our discussion, we have\\ncategorized all the baselines into three distinct categories: RNN-\\nbased models, attention-based models, and graph neural network(GNN)-based spatio-temporal prediction models. Below, we provide\\ndetailed descriptions of each baseline category:\\nRNN-based Spatio-Temporal Methods:\\n\u2022ST-LSTM [33]: It incorporates the Long Short-Term Memory to\\ncapture temporal dependencies in the spatio-temporal data.\\n\u2022AGCRN [1]: RNNs are employed to capture temporal correlations,\\nallowing for the representation of the evolving patterns over time.\\n\u2022DMVSTNET [39]: In this method, RNNs are utilized to effectively\\nmodel temporal dependencies, capturing the patterns that evolve\\nover time. Furthermore, convolutional networks and fully con-\\nnected layers are employed to capture local spatial correlations\\nand establish meaningful spatial relationships.\\nAttention-based Spatio-Temporal Approaches:\\n\u2022ASTGCN [8]: In this method, attention mechanisms are employed\\nto capture multi-granularity temporal correlation features.\\n\u2022STWA [5]: The model incorporates personalized temporal and\\nspatial parameters into the attention module, allowing for the\\nmodeling of dynamic spatio-temporal correlations.\\nSpatio-Temporal GNNs:\\n\u2022GWN [37]: It incorporates a learnable graph structure and 1-D\\nconvolutions to effectively learn spatio-temporal dependencies.\\n\u2022MTGNN [36]: It utilizes a learnable graph structure to model\\nmultivariate temporal correlations. MTGNN employs 1-D dilation\\nconvolutions to generate temporal representations.\\n\u2022TGCN [47]: This model combines graph neural networks (GNNs)\\nfor spatial correlation modeling and recurrent neural networks\\n(RNNs) for temporal correlation modeling.\\n\u2022STGCN [42]: It uses gated temporal convolutions and GNNs to\\nmodel temporal and spatial dependencies, respectively.\\n\u2022STSGCN [26]: It introduces a spatio-temporal graph construction\\nto learn spatial correlations across adjacent time steps.\\nA.2 Case study\\nIn this section, we assess the effectiveness of different large lan-\\nguage models (LLMs) in zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction sce-\\nnarios, as illustrated in Table 3 and Table 4. The instructions pro-\\nvided to the models are clearly indicated in blue font. The results\\ndemonstrate that various LLMs are capable of generating predic-\\ntions based on these instructions, thereby highlighting the effective-\\nness of the prompt design. For instance, ChatGPT relies on historical\\naverages rather than explicitly incorporating temporal or spatial\\ndata in its predictions. Llama-2-70b analyzes specific time periods\\nand regions, but it encounters challenges in encoding numerical\\ntime-series dependencies, resulting in suboptimal predictive perfor-\\nmance. On the other hand, Claude-2.1 effectively summarizes and\\nanalyzes historical data, leveraging peak-hour patterns and points\\nof interest to achieve more accurate traffic trend predictions.\\nOur proposed UrbanGPT seamlessly integrates spatio-temporal\\ncontextual signals with the reasoning capabilities of large language\\nmodels (LLMs) through a spatio-temporal instruction-tuning para-\\ndigm. This integration leads to remarkable improvements in predict-\\ning numerical values and spatio-temporal trends. These findings\\nunderscore the potential and effectiveness of our framework in\\ncapturing universal spatio-temporal patterns, making zero-shot\\nspatio-temporal prediction practical and achievable.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 11\\n\\nTable 3: We examine the zero-shot predictions of different LLMs for bicycle flow in NYC with the provided instructions.\\nInstructions: Given the historical data for bike flow over 12 time steps in a specific region of New York City, the recorded bike inflows\\nare [12 8 9 15 10 12 14 9 6 12 25 20], and the recorded bike outflows are [5 12 12 15 10 11 6 9 4 6 10 15].

To improve prediction accuracy, a spatio-temporal model is\\nutilized to encode the historical bike data as tokens <ST_Start><ST_HIS><ST_HIS><ST_End>, where the first and the second tokens\\ncorrespond to the representations of bike inflow and outflow. Please conduct an analysis of the traffic patterns in this region, taking into\\naccount the provided time and regional information, and then generate the predictions (the predictive tokens for regression).\\nGround true: Based on the given information, the predictions of bike inflow and outflow in this region are [26 38 28 24 20 13 16 9 5 3\\n5 2] and[12 19 10 10 11 9 6 5 4 4 2 2] .\\nLlama-2-70b Responds: Based on the provided historical data, I have ...

Predicted Bike Outflow: [9.58 9.58... 9.58] ...\\nClaude-2.1 Responds: Based on the provided historical data, this region in Staten Island seems to experience fluctuating yet relatively\\nlow bike traffic flow during the daytime on Tuesdays. The bike inflows range from 6 to 15 per 30-minute interval, while outflows range\\nfrom 4 to 15.Given the region covers education, cultural, commercial, and transportation facilities within a 1km radius, the bike traffic\\nlikely corresponds to people traveling to and from these points of interest. The fluctuations could reflect class/work schedules and\\ntransportation needs throughout the day.For the evening prediction period of 6PM to 11:30PM, we may expect some further fluctuations\\nbut generally declining bike traffic as the day turns to night. People would be finishing up activities and heading home. I would predict\\nthe following bike inflows and outflows for the next 12 time steps: [10 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 1 1] and[8 6 5 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 1 1] ...\\nUrbanGPT Responds: Based on the given information, the predictions (predicted tokens) of bike inflow and outflow in this region are\\n<ST_PRE> [20 21 22 21 17 12 9 7 6 5 5 5] and <ST_PRE> [11 10 8 7 6 6 5 4 4 3 3 2] .\\nTable 4: Zero-shot predictions of different LLMs for taxi flow in NYC with the provided instructions (without spatial information).\\nInstructions: Given the historical data for taxi flow over 12 time steps in a specific region of New York City, the recorded taxi inflows\\nare [111 86 90 78 49 75 46 32 20 14 9 9], and the recorded taxi outflows are [100 91 58 39 47 47 19 22 21 9 16 10].

We can expect lower taxi\\ndemand during later Sunday evening, with some pickup around end-of-weekend times and early Monday commute times. The region\\nis unspecified, so we cannot infer any location-specific usage patterns. Inflow ranges from 49-111 taxis over the 30 minute intervals.\\nOutflow ranges from 19-100 taxis. This indicates the region likely serves both residential and commercial purposes.\\nPrediction: Inflows: [25 15 10 8 7 9 15 25 35 40 45 50] .

Instead of applying regular convolutional and recurrent units, we formulate the problem on graphs and build the model with complete convolutional structures. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that to apply purely convolutional structures to extract spatio-temporal features simultaneously from graph-structured time series in a traffic study.\\n\\n## Problem Formulation\\n\\nTraffic forecast is a typical time-series prediction problem, i.e. predicting the most likely traffic measurements (e.g. speed or traffic flow) in the next $H$ time steps given the previous $M$ observations from traffic network $G$ as,\\n\\n[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/8719e09f4306b30b0639b5fbe3ccf41c4f61439ba114f7a5c5ea62737e137106/68747470733a2f2f6c617465782e636f6465636f67732e636f6d2f7376672e696d6167653f5c6c617267652673706163653b5c6861747b767d5f7b742b317d2c2673706163653b2e2e2e2c2673706163653b5c6861747b767d5f7b742b487d3d5c6d6174686f707b5c6172675c6d61787d5f7b765f7b742b317d2c2673706163653b2e2e2e2c2673706163653b765f7b742b487d7d2673706163653b5c6c6f672673706163653b5028765f7b742b317d2c2673706163653b2e2e2e2c765f7b742b487d7c765f7b742d4d2b317d2c2673706163653b2e2e2e2c765f743b4729)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/8719e09f4306b30b0639b5fbe3ccf41c4f61439ba114f7a5c5ea62737e137106/68747470733a2f2f6c617465782e636f6465636f67732e636f6d2f7376672e696d6167653f5c6c617267652673706163653b5c6861747b767d5f7b742b317d2c2673706163653b2e2e2e2c2673706163653b5c6861747b767d5f7b742b487d3d5c6d6174686f707b5c6172675c6d61787d5f7b765f7b742b317d2c2673706163653b2e2e2e2c2673706163653b765f7b742b487d7d2673706163653b5c6c6f672673706163653b5028765f7b742b317d2c2673706163653b2e2e2e2c765f7b742b487d7c765f7b742d4d2b317d2c2673706163653b2e2e2e2c765f743b4729)\\n\\n[![](/VeritasYin/STGCN_IJCAI-18/raw/master/figures/Graph_Structured_Traffic_Data.png)](/VeritasYin/STGCN_IJCAI-18/blob/master/figures/Graph_Structured_Traffic_Data.png)\\n\\n**Fig.1 Graph-structured traffic data.**  \\nEach $v\\\\_t$ indicates a frame of current traffic status at time step $t$, which is recorded in a graph-structured data matrix.\\n\\n## Network Structure\\n\\n[![](/VeritasYin/STGCN_IJCAI-18/raw/master/figures/STGCN.png)](/VeritasYin/STGCN_IJCAI-18/blob/master/figures/STGCN.png)\\n\\n**Fig. 2 Architecture of spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks.**  \\nThe framework STGCN consists of two spatio-temporal convolutional blocks (ST-Conv blocks) and a fully-connected output layer in the end.

This has significant implications in the field\\nof urban computing, where the ability to predict transportation\\npatterns can optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance\\noverall urban mobility [ 18,31]. Moreover, anticipating population\\nmovement can aid in effective urban planning and resource alloca-\\ntion [ 7,20]. Additionally, the ability to forecast crimes can greatly\\ncontribute to enhancing public safety [ 32]. Spatio-temporal predic-\\ntion plays a vital role in shaping smarter and more efficient cities,\\nultimately leading to an improved quality of urban life.\\nIt is important to highlight the various types of neural network\\narchitectures commonly adopted in this domain of spatio-temporal\\nprediction. These architectures are designed to capture and model\\nthe complex relationships between spatial and temporal dimensions\\nin the data. One widely employed architecture is the Convolutional\\nNeural Network (CNN) [ 15,39,45], which is effective in extract-\\ning spatial features by applying convolutional filters across the\\ninput data. Another line of spatio-temporal neural networks is the\\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) family [ 1,34,43]. Those spatio-\\ntemporal RNNs are well-suited for capturing temporal dependencies\\nby maintaining a memory state that can retain information over\\ntime. Recently, there has been a surge in the use of Graph Neural\\nNetworks (GNNs) for spatio-temporal prediction [ 36,40,47]. GNNs\\nexcel in modeling complex spatial relationships in data represented\\nas graphs, where each node corresponds to a spatial location and\\nedges capture the connections between them.\\nWhile current spatio-temporal neural network techniques have\\nproven to be highly effective, it is crucial to acknowledge their\\nstrong dependence on having an abundance of labeled data in order\\nto generate accurate predictions. However, the pervasive problem\\nof data scarcity in practical urban sensing scenarios poses a sig-\\nnificant challenge. For example, deploying sensors throughout the\\nentire urban space to monitor citywide traffic volume or air qual-\\nity is impractical due to the high cost involved [ 17,41]. Moreover,\\nthe challenge of limited labeled data availability extends to spatio-\\ntemporal forecasting across different cities, in which acquiring\\nlabeled data for each target city becomes a daunting task [ 13,38].\\nThese issues emphasize the pressing need for novel solutions that\\naddress data scarcity and enhance the generalization capabilities of\\nspatio-temporal models in various smart city applications.\\nInspired by the remarkable progress of large language models\\n(LLMs), our primary goal is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that\\npossesses outstanding generalization capabilities across a wide\\narray of urban tasks.

These hurdles call for meticulous model\\ndesign to bridge the gap between the unique characteristics of\\nspatio-temporal data and the knowledge encoded within LLMs.\\nContributions . In light of these challenges, we propose UrbanGPT,\\na large language model specifically tailored for spatio-temporal\\nprediction. At the core of UrbanGPT lies a novel spatio-temporal\\ninstruction-tuning paradigm that seeks to align the intricate de-\\npendencies of time and space, with the knowledge space of LLMs.\\nWithin our UrbanGPT framework, we start by incorporating a\\nspatio-temporal dependency encoder, which utilizes a multi-level\\ntemporal convolutional network. This encoder enables the model\\nto capture the intricate temporal dynamics present in the spatio-\\ntemporal data across various time resolutions. Then, our model\\ninvolves aligning textual and spatio-temporal information to em-\\npower language models in effectively injecting spatio-temporal\\ncontextual signals. This is achieved through the utilization of a\\nlightweight alignment module that projects the representations\\nof spatio-temporal dependencies. The result is the generation of\\nmore expressive semantic representations by integrating valuable\\ninformation from both textual and spatio-temporal domains.\\nThrough the incorporation of spatio-temporal information dur-\\ning the instruction-tuning process, the language model gains profi-\\nciency in understanding and processing the intricate relationships\\nand patterns found in spatio-temporal data. By leveraging the in-\\nsights obtained from the spatio-temporal domain, the language\\nmodel becomes better equipped to capture the nuances and com-\\nplexities of spatio-temporal phenomena. This, in turn, enables the\\nmodel to make more reliable and insightful predictions across vari-\\nous urban scenarios, even when faced with limited data availability.\\nTo showcase the superior predictive performance of our pro-\\nposed model, we compare it with the large language model (LLaMA-\\n70B) and the spatio-temporal graph neural network (STGCN) in azero-shot traffic flow prediction scenario guided by textual instruc-\\ntions, as depicted in Figure 1. The large language model, LLaMA,\\neffectively infers traffic patterns from the input text. However, its\\nlimitations in handling numeric time-series data with complex spa-\\ntial and temporal dependencies can sometimes lead to opposite\\ntraffic trend predictions. On the other hand, the pre-trained base-\\nline model demonstrates a strong understanding of spatio-temporal\\ndependencies. However, it may suffer from overfitting to the source\\ndataset and underperform in zero-shot scenarios, indicating its lim-\\nited generalization capabilities beyond existing spatio-temporal\\nprediction models. In contrast, our proposed model achieves a har-\\nmonious integration of domain-specific spatio-temporal knowledge\\nand language modeling capabilities. This enables us to make more\\naccurate and reliable predictions under data scarcity.\\nIn summary, our main contributions can be outlined as follows:\\n\u2022To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop\\na spatio-temporal large language model capable of predicting\\ndiverse urban phenomena across different datasets, especially\\nunder conditions of limited data availability.\\n\u2022We propose UrbanGPT, a spatio-temporal prediction framework\\nthat empowers large language models (LLMs) to comprehend\\nthe intricate inter-dependencies across time and space. This is\\nachieved through the seamless integration of a spatio-temporal\\ndependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm, ef-\\nfectively aligning the spatio-temporal context with LLMs.\\n\u2022Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets\\nprovide compelling evidence of our proposed UrbanGPT\u2019s excep-\\ntional ability to generalize in zero-shot spatio-temporal learning\\nscenarios. These findings highlight the model\u2019s robust general-\\nization capacity, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately\\npredicting and understanding spatio-temporal patterns, even in\\nscenarios where no prior training data is available.\\n2 PRELIMINARIES\\nSpatio-Temporal Data . Spatio-temporal data is commonly col-\\nlected and can be represented as a three-dimensional tensor X\u2208\\nR\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc47\u00d7\ud835\udc39. Each element X\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udc53in the tensor corresponds to the value\\nof the\ud835\udc53-th feature at the \ud835\udc61-th time interval in the \ud835\udc5f-th region. To\\nprovide an example, let\u2019s consider predicting taxi traffic patterns in\\nan urban area. In this scenario, the data can represent the inflow\\nand outflow of taxis in a specific region ( e.g., the\ud835\udc5f-th spatial area)\\nduring a given time period from \ud835\udc61to\ud835\udc61\u22121(e.g., a 30-minute interval).\\nSpatio-Temporal Forecasting. In spatio-temporal prediction tasks,\\na common scenario involves forecasting future trends using histor-\\nical data. Specifically, the goal is to predict the data for the next \ud835\udc43\\ntime steps based on information from the preceding \ud835\udc3bsteps.\\nX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+\ud835\udc43=\ud835\udc53(X\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e\u2212\ud835\udc3b+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e) (1)\\nThe function \ud835\udc53(\u00b7)represents a spatio-temporal prediction model\\nthat has been trained effectively using historical data. Spatio-temporal\\nprediction tasks can be divided into two main categories: regression\\nprediction, which involves predicting continuous values like traffic\\nflow or taxi demand [ 22], and classification prediction, where the\\ngoal is to classify events such as crime occurrence prediction [ 11].\\nTo optimize the model \ud835\udc53(\u00b7), different loss functions are utilized\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 3\\n\\nbased on the specific characteristics of the spatio-temporal scenar-\\nios.\\nSpatio-Temporal Zero-Shot Learning . Despite the effectiveness\\nof current spatio-temporal learning approaches, they often en-\\ncounter difficulties in effectively generalizing across a wide range of\\ndownstream spatio-temporal learning scenarios. In this study, our\\nfocus is on addressing the challenge of spatio-temporal zero-shot\\nscenarios, where we aim to learn from previously unseen data in\\ndownstream spatio-temporal prediction datasets or tasks. This can\\nbe formally defined as follows:\\n\u02dcX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+\ud835\udc43=\u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u02dcX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e\u2212\ud835\udc3b+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e) (2)\\nIn this particular scenario, the prediction function \u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u00b7)is responsi-\\nble for forecasting the spatio-temporal data \u02dcXfrom downstream\\ntasks that have not been previously encountered. It should be noted\\nthat the model \u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u00b7)is not trained specifically on the target data.\\n3 METHODOLOGY\\n3.1 Spatio-Temporal Dependency Encoder\\nAlthough large language models demonstrate exceptional profi-\\nciency in language processing, they face challenges in comprehend-\\ning the time-evolving patterns inherent in spatio-temporal data. To\\novercome this limitation, we propose enhancing the capability of\\nlarge language models to capture temporal dependencies within\\nspatio-temporal contexts. This is accomplished by integrating a\\nspatio-temporal encoder that incorporates a multi-level tempo-\\nral convolutional network. By doing so, we enable the model to\\neffectively capture the intricate temporal dependencies across vari-\\nous time resolutions, thereby improving its understanding of the\\ncomplex temporal dynamics present in the spatio-temporal data.\\nSpecifically, our spatio-temporal encoder is composed of two key\\ncomponents: a gated dilated convolution layer and a multi-level\\ncorrelation injection layer. Let\u2019s formalize this architecture as:\\n\u03a8(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f=(\u00afW(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc58\u2217E(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+\u00afb(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc58)\u00b7\ud835\udeff(\u00afW(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc54\u2217E(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+\u00afb(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc54)+E\u2032(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f (3)\\nWe begin with the initial spatio-temporal embedding, denoted as\\nE\ud835\udc5f\u2208R\ud835\udc47\u00d7\ud835\udc51. This embedding is obtained by enhancing the original\\ndata Xthrough a linear layer. To address the issue of gradient\\nvanishing, we utilize a slice of E\ud835\udc5f, denoted as E\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5f\u2208R\ud835\udc47\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51, which\\nis determined by the size of the dilated convolutional kernel. This\\nslice is employed for performing residual operations. To perform\\nthe residual operations, we use 1-D dilated convolution kernels\\n\u00afW\ud835\udc58and \u00afW\ud835\udc54\u2208R\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc54\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61, along with the corresponding bias\\nterms \u00afb\ud835\udc58and \u00afb\ud835\udc54\u2208R\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61. The sigmoid activation function \ud835\udeffis\\napplied to control the degree of information preservation during the\\nrepeated convolution operation. After the gated temporal dilated\\nconvolutional layer encoding, we are able to effectively capture the\\ntemporal dependencies across multiple time steps, resulting in the\\ngeneration of temporal representations.\\nThese representations contain different levels of temporal de-\\npendencies, reflecting various granularity-aware time-evolving pat-\\nterns. To preserve these informative patterns, we introduce a multi-\\nlevel correlation injection layer. This layer is designed to incorpo-\\nrate correlations between different levels and is formalized as:\\nS(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f=(W(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc60\u2217\u03a8(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+b(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc60)+S(\ud835\udc59\u22121)\\n\ud835\udc5f (4)We have the convolution kernel W\ud835\udc60\u2208R\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc46\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\u00d7\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61and the bias\\nvector b\ud835\udc60\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61. These are employed after \ud835\udc3flayers of encoding.\\nA simple non-linear layer is employed to merge the results from\\nequations 3 and 4, and the final spatio-temporal dependency repre-\\nsentations of are denoted as \u02dc\u03a8\u2208R\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc39\u00d7\ud835\udc51. To address the diverse\\nset of urban scenarios that may arise downstream, our proposed\\nspatio-temporal encoder is designed to be independent of graph\\nstructures when modeling spatial correlations. This is particularly\\ncrucial because in zero-shot prediction contexts, the spatial rela-\\ntionships between entities may be unknown or difficult to ascertain.\\nBy not relying on explicit graph structures, our encoder can effec-\\ntively handle a broad spectrum of urban scenarios, where spatial\\ncorrelations and dependencies can vary or be challenging to define\\nin advance. This flexibility enables our model to adapt and perform\\nwell, ensuring its applicability in a wide range of urban contexts.\\n3.2 Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning\\n3.2.1 Spatio-Temporal-Text Alignment. In order to enable lan-\\nguage models to effectively comprehend spatio-temporal patterns,\\nit is crucial to align textual and spatio-temporal information. This\\nalignment allows for the fusion of different modalities, resulting\\nin a more informative representation. By integrating contextual\\nfeatures from both textual and spatio-temporal domains, we can\\ncapture complementary information and extract higher-level se-\\nmantic representations that are more expressive and meaningful.\\nTo achieve this objective, we utilize a lightweight alignment mod-\\nule to project the spatio-temporal dependencies representations\\n\u02dc\u03a8. This projection involves the use of parameters W\ud835\udc5d\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f\\nandb\ud835\udc5d\u2208R\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, where\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3frepresents the commonly used hidden\\ndimension in language models (LLMs).\\nThe resulting projection, denoted as H\u2208R\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc39\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, are rep-\\nresented in the instructions using special tokens as: <ST_start>,\\n<ST_HIS>, ..., <ST_HIS>, <ST_end>. Here, <ST_start> and <ST_end>\\nserve as identifiers marking the beginning and end of the spatio-\\ntemporal token. These identifiers can be included in the large-\\nscale language model by expanding its vocabulary. The placeholder\\n<ST_HIS> represents the spatio-temporal token and corresponds to\\nthe projection Hin the hidden layer. By employing this technique,\\nthe model gains the ability to discern spatio-temporal dependen-\\ncies, thereby enhancing its proficiency in successfully performing\\nspatio-temporal predictive tasks within urban scenes.\\n3.2.2 Spatio-Temporal Prompt Instructions. In scenarios in-\\nvolving spatio-temporal prediction, both temporal and spatial in-\\nformation contain valuable semantic details that contribute to the\\nmodel\u2019s understanding of spatio-temporal patterns within specific\\ncontexts. For instance, traffic flow in the early morning differs sig-\\nnificantly from rush hour, and there are variations in traffic patterns\\nbetween commercial and residential areas. As a result, we recognize\\nthe potential of representing both temporal and spatial information\\nas prompt instruction text. We leverage the text understanding\\ncapabilities of large language models to encode this information,\\nenabling associative reasoning for downstream tasks.\\nIn our UrbanGPT framework, we integrate multi-granularity\\ntime information and spatial details as instruction inputs for the\\nlarge language model. Time information includes factors such as\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 4\\n\\nl = 1l = 2l = 3\\nGateSpatio -Temporal dependenc yencoder\\nLLMs spaceLightweight alignment moduleSpatio -Temporal Instruction -Tuning\\nGiven the historical data and the corresponding tokens\\n<ST_HIS> fortaxi flow \u2026The recording time \u2026This region\\nislocated \u2026Please generate thepredictive tokens for\u2026\\nBased onthe given information, the predictive tokens\\noftaxi inflow and outflow inthis region are<ST_PRE> \u2026\\nLarge Language Models\\nInflow\uff1a[28 26 20 33 49  50 48 34 40 22 \u2026]\\nOutflow\uff1a[40 52 58 32 22 10 18 19 20 24\u2026]City A\\nCity B\\n\u2026\\nInstruction -Tuning Zero -shot prediction\\n<ST_HIS> <ST_HIS> Multi -tasks\\nRegression Layer<ST_HIS> <ST_ PRE> \\ntokens\\nText Replacement\\nLlama VicunaAlignment\\nRegressionST Encoder\\nTask assignment\\nText instructionsInstructions\\nResponsesRegion A\\nRegion B\\nFrozen Trainable\\n\u2026\\nSpatio -Temporal Zero -shot prediction\\nTrain city\\nTest cityTrain region\\nTest region\\nST dependency representations ST Instruction -Tuning of LLMsFigure 2: The overall architecture of the proposed spatio-temporal language model UrbanGPT.\\nTemporal Information :The recording time ofthehistorical data is'January 7,2020 ,08:30,\\nTuesday toJanuary 7,2020 ,14:00,Tuesday, with data points recorded at30-minute intervals' .\\nSpatial Information :Here istheregion information :This region islocated within theStaten\\nIsland borough district and encompasses various POIs within athree -kilometer radius,\\ncovering Public Safety, Education Facility, Residential categories .\\nTask description :Now wewant topredict thetaxi inflow and outflow forthenext 12time\\nsteps during thetime period of'January 7,2020 ,14:30,Tuesday toJanuary 7,2020 ,20:00,\\nTuesday, with data points recorded at30-minute intervals' .\\nFigure 3: Illustration of spatio-temporal prompt instructions\\nencoding the time- and location-aware information.\\nthe day of the week and the hour of the day, while regional in-\\nformation encompasses the city, administrative areas, and nearby\\npoints of interest (POI) data, among others. By incorporating these\\ndiverse elements, UrbanGPT is capable of identifying and assimi-\\nlating spatio-temporal patterns across different regions and time-\\nframes. This enables the model to encapsulate these insights within\\ncomplex spatio-temporal contexts, thereby enhancing its ability\\nfor zero-shot reasoning. The design of the instructional text for\\nspatio-temporal information is illustrated in Figure 3.\\n3.2.3 Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning of LLMs. When\\nit comes to incorporating detailed spatio-temporal textual descrip-\\ntions, the next stage is to fine-tune large language models (LLMs)\\nusing instructions to generate spatio-temporal forecasts in textual\\nformat. However, this approach poses two challenges. Firstly , spatio-\\ntemporal forecasting typically relies on numerical data, which dif-\\nfers in structure and patterns from natural language that language\\nmodels excel at processing, focusing on semantic and syntactic rela-\\ntionships. Secondly , large language models are typically pre-trained\\nusing a multi-classification loss to predict vocabulary, resulting in a\\nprobability distribution of potential outcomes. This contrasts with\\nthe continuous value distribution required for regression tasks.\\nTo address these challenges, UrbanGPT adopts a different strat-\\negy by refraining from directly predicting future spatio-temporal\\nvalues. Instead, it generates forecasting tokens that aid in the pre-\\ndiction process. These tokens are subsequently passed through a\\nregression layer, which maps the hidden representations to generate\\nmore accurate predictive values. The formulation of the regressionlayer in our spatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm is:\\n\u02c6Y\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53=W3[\ud835\udf0e(W1H\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53),\ud835\udf0e(W2\u0393\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53)] (5)\\nThe prediction result, denoted as \u02c6Y\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53\u2208R\ud835\udc43, is obtained using the\\nrectified linear unit activation function, represented by \ud835\udf0e. The hid-\\nden representations of the forecasting tokens, denoted as \u0393\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53\u2208\\nR\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, are introduced as a novel term in the vocabulary of large lan-\\nguage models (LLMs). The regression layer is formulated using\\nweight matrices W1\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f,W2\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, and W3\u2208R\ud835\udc43\u00d72\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n,\\nwhere[\u00b7,\u00b7]represents the concatenation operation. While the prob-\\nability distribution of the forecasting tokens remains relatively\\nstable, their hidden representations contain rich spatio-temporal\\ncontextual attributes that capture dynamic spatio-temporal interde-\\npendencies. This enables our model to provide precise predictions\\nby leveraging this contextual information.\\n3.3 Model Optimization\\nBuilding upon the baseline model [ 1,8], we adopt the absolute error\\nloss as our regression loss function. This choice allows us to effec-\\ntively handle predictions across a wide range of urban scenarios.\\nAdditionally, we introduce a classification loss as a joint loss to\\ncater to diverse task requirements. To ensure optimal performance,\\nour model optimizes different losses based on the specific task in-\\nputs. For instance, we utilize the regression loss for tasks such as\\ntraffic flow prediction, while employing the classification loss for\\ntasks like crime prediction. This approach enables our model to\\neffectively address the unique challenges posed by each task and\\ndeliver accurate predictions in various urban scenarios.\\nL\ud835\udc50=\u22121\\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01\\n\ud835\udc56=1[\ud835\udeff(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)\u00b7log(\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)+(1\u2212\ud835\udeff(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56))\u00b7log(1\u2212\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)]\\nL\ud835\udc5f=1\\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01\\n\ud835\udc56=1|\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\u2212\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56|;L=L\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc60+L\ud835\udc5f+L\ud835\udc50 (6)\\nHere,\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56represents a sample from \u02c6Y, and\ud835\udc41represents the total\\nnumber of samples, which is calculated as the product of \ud835\udc45,\ud835\udc47, and\\n\ud835\udc39.

To\\ncapture probability distributions from the prediction, we employ\\nthe sigmoid function denoted by \ud835\udeff. Each of these loss functions\\nplays a specific role in our model, allowing us to effectively handle\\nclassification, regression, and language modeling tasks as needed.\\n4 EVALUATION\\nIn this section, we aim to assess the capabilities of our proposed\\nmodel across various settings by addressing five key questions:\\n\u2022RQ1 : What is the performance and generalization capability of\\nUrbanGPT in diverse zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction tasks?\\n\u2022RQ2 : How does UrbanGPT perform when compared to existing\\nspatio-temporal models in classical supervised scenarios?\\n\u2022RQ3 : What specific contributions do the proposed key compo-\\nnents bring to enhance the capabilities of our UrbanGPT model?\\n\u2022RQ4 : Can the proposed model robustly handle the forecasting\\nscenarios with varying spatio-temporal patterns?\\n4.1 Experimental Setting\\n4.1.1 Dataset Description. To evaluate the effectiveness of the\\nproposed model in predicting spatio-temporal patterns across var-\\nious urban computing scenarios, we conducted experiments us-\\ning four distinct datasets: NYC-taxi, NYC-bike, NYC-crime, and\\nCHI-taxi. These datasets encompass a wide range of data sources\\nto capture the dynamic nature of urban environments, including\\nrecords of taxi travel, bike trajectories, crime incidents in New York\\nCity, and taxi travel data in Chicago. To facilitate our analysis, we\\npartitioned the cities into grid-like regions based on latitude and\\nlongitude information. Within specific time intervals, we aggre-\\ngated statistical measures for each region. For example, this in-\\nvolved calculating the number of taxi inflows and outflows within\\na 30-minute period in region A, or determining the count of theft\\nincidents within a day in region B. Furthermore, Points of Interest\\n(POIs) data can be obtained through APIs provided by map services,\\nutilizing the latitude and longitude of different regions. For more\\ncomprehensive data descriptions, please refer to the Appendix.\\n4.1.2 Evaluation Protocols. In order to investigate the capabili-\\nties of large language models in analyzing diverse spatio-temporal\\ndata across different regions, we selected a subset of taxi, bike, and\\ncrime data from various areas of New York City as our training set.\\n\u2022Zero-Shot Learning Scenarios . We assessed the model perfor-\\nmance by predicting future spatio-temporal data from regions in\\nNYC or even Chicago that were unseen in the training phase.\\n\u2022Supervised Learning Scenarios . We evaluated the model using\\nfuture data from the same regions as the training set.\\nFor regression tasks, we maintained a consistent training and test-\\ning methodology across all baseline models. When it came to classi-\\nfication tasks involving crime data, we utilized binary cross-entropy\\nas the loss function for training and testing the models. Our ex-\\nperiments were conducted using the robust vicuna-7b [ 50] as the\\nfoundational large language model for UrbanGPT. For a more com-\\nprehensive understanding of our methodology and experimental\\nsetup, please refer to the appendix for detailed information.4.1.3 Evaluation Metrics. For regression tasks, we employed\\nMAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)\\nas evaluation metrics. These metrics quantify the discrepancies\\nbetween the predicted outcomes and the actual labels, with lower\\nvalues indicating superior performance [ 12,49]. In the case of clas-\\nsification tasks, we utilized Recall and Macro-F1 as evaluation met-\\nrics to assess performance. Recall measures the model\u2019s ability to\\ncorrectly identify positive instances, while Macro-F1 is a compre-\\nhensive performance metric that combines precision and recall to\\nprovide an overall measure of classification accuracy [11, 30].\\n4.1.4 Baseline Model. We conducted a thorough comparison\\nwith 10 advanced models to establish baselines for our proposed\\nmethod. (i)In the category of RNNs-based spatio-temporal forecast-\\ning methods, we compared our proposed method with AGCRN [ 1],\\nDMVSTNET [ 39] and ST-LSTM [ 33]. These approaches leverage\\nRNNs for modeling and prediction. (ii)The GNNs-based spatio-\\ntemporal models primarily utilize graph neural networks to cap-\\nture spatial correlations and integrate temporal encoders to capture\\nspatio-temporal relationships. The models we compared against\\nin this category include GWN [ 37], MTGNN [ 36], STSGCN [ 26],\\nTGCN [ 47], and STGCN [ 42].(iii) In the attention-based spatio-\\ntemporal models category, the methods employ attention mecha-\\nnisms to model spatio-temporal correlations. The models we com-\\npared against in this category are ASTGCN [8] and STWA [5].\\n4.2 Zero-Shot Prediction Performance (RQ1)\\nIn this section, we thoroughly evaluate the predictive performance\\nof our proposed model in zero-shot scenarios. The results of our\\nevaluation are presented in Table 1 and visualized in Figure 4. Our\\nobjective is to assess the model\u2019s effectiveness in predicting spatio-\\ntemporal patterns in geographical areas that it has not encountered\\nduring training. This evaluation encompasses both cross-region\\nand cross-city settings, allowing us to gain insights into the model\u2019s\\ngeneralization capabilities across different locations.\\n4.2.1 Prediction on Unseen Regions within a City. Cross-\\nregion scenarios entail using data from certain regions within a\\ncity to forecast future conditions in other regions that have not\\nbeen encountered by the model. Through a thorough analysis of\\nthe model\u2019s performance in these cross-region predictions, we can\\ndraw attention to three significant observations:\\ni) Superior Zero-shot Predictive Performance . The results pre-\\nsented in Table 1 highlight the exceptional performance of our\\nproposed model in both regression and classification tasks on vari-\\nous datasets, surpassing the baseline models in zero-shot prediction.\\nThe success of our model can be attributed to two key factors.\\n\u2022Spatio-Temporal-Text-Alignment . The alignment of spatio-\\ntemporal contextual signals with the text comprehension abil-\\nities of language models plays a pivotal role in the success of\\nour proposed model. This fusion enables the model to effectively\\ncapitalize on both the encoded urban dynamics from the spa-\\ntiotemporal signals and the comprehensive understanding of\\ntextual context provided by the LLMs. By leveraging these two\\nessential aspects, our model achieves the remarkable ability to\\ngeneralize its prediction capabilities in zero-shot scenarios.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 6\\n\\nTable 1: Our model\u2019s performance in zero-shot prediction is evaluated on three diverse datasets: NYC-taxi, NYC-bike, and\\nNYC-crime, providing a comprehensive assessment of its predictive capabilities in unseen situations.\\nModelDataset NYC-taxi NYC-bike NYC-crime\\nType Inflow Outflow Inflow Outflow Burglary Robbery\\nMetrics MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE Macro-F1 Recall Macro-F1 Recall\\nAGCRN 10.86 26.51 13.15 36.45 3.41 7.98 3.42 8.08 0.48 0.00 0.49 0.01\\nASTGCN 9.75 24.12 12.42 33.28 5.58 11.58 5.78 12.29 0.49 0.01 0.55 0.09\\nGWN 10.73 26.50 9.67 26.74 3.32 8.17 3.07 7.52 0.48 0.00 0.52 0.04\\nMTGNN 10.16 25.84 12.59 35.38 3.18 7.62 3.20 7.65 0.64 0.27 0.65 0.30\\nSTWA 11.28 28.97 13.54 38.61 4.59 10.94 4.35 10.67 0.48 0.00 0.51 0.03\\nSTSGCN 18.97 41.38 20.07 45.79 6.85 14.98 6.54 14.77 0.48 0.00 0.48 0.00\\nSTGCN 12.54 30.80 14.32 39.58 4.11 9.21 4.45 9.62 0.48 0.00 0.64 0.30\\nTGCN 10.04 25.10 10.98 30.03 2.88 6.55 2.91 6.42 0.56 0.10 0.58 0.13\\nDMVSTNET 11.00 28.29 10.59 29.20 3.80 9.87 3.65 9.21 0.48 0.01 0.59 0.15\\nST-LSTM 16.97 34.43 18.93 44.10 7.78 15.41 6.92 17.12 0.48 0.00 0.49 0.03\\nUrbanGPT 6.16 16.92 6.83 21.78 2.02 5.16 2.01 5.03 0.67 0.34 0.69 0.42\\n\u2022Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning . This adaptive tuning\\nprocess empowers the LLM to effectively integrate crucial in-\\nformation from the instructions, enhancing its comprehension\\nof the complex relationships and dependencies between spatial\\nand temporal factors. By seamlessly merging the spatio-temporal\\ninstruction-tuning with the spatio-temporal dependency encoder,\\nour proposed model, UrbanGPT, successfully preserves universal\\nand transferable spatio-temporal knowledge. Consequently, the\\nmodel becomes capable of capturing the fundamental patterns\\nand dynamics that govern spatio-temporal phenomena, enabling\\nit to make precise predictions in downstream zero-shot scenarios.\\nii) Enhanced Urban Semantic Understanding . Urban seman-\\ntics offer valuable insights into the diverse dimensions of spatial\\nand temporal characteristics. Our approach involves training our\\nmodel on a wide range of datasets, enriching its understanding\\nof spatio-temporal dynamics across different timeframes and geo-\\ngraphical locations. In contrast, baseline models tend to prioritize\\nencoding temporal and spatial dependencies, neglecting the nu-\\nanced semantics that differentiate regions, timeframes, and data\\ncategories. By incorporating comprehensive semantic awareness\\ninto our UrbanGPT, we significantly enhance its ability to make\\naccurate zero-shot predictions in previously unseen regions.\\niii) Improved Performance in Sparse Data Scenarios . Predict-\\ning spatio-temporal patterns in sparse data environments is chal-\\nlenging as models tend to overfit when data points are scarce. This\\nchallenge is particularly notable when predicting crimes, where data\\nis often sparse but crucial for accurate predictions. Baseline mod-\\nels struggle in cross-regional prediction tasks under these sparse\\nconditions, resulting in low recall scores that indicate potential over-\\nfitting. To overcome this limitation, our model integrates spatio-\\ntemporal learning with large language models (LLMs) using an\\neffective spatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm. By incorpo-\\nrating rich semantic insights, our approach enhances the model\u2019s\\nspatio-temporal representations, enabling it to effectively handle\\nsparse data and achieve improved prediction accuracy.\\n4.2.2 Cross-City Prediction Task. To assess the performance of\\nour model in cross-city prediction tasks, we conducted tests on the\\nCHI-taxi dataset, which was not seen during the training phase. The\\nresults, depicted in Figure 4, yielded the following observations:\u2022Consistency in Multi-step Prediction : Our model consistently\\noutperforms the comparison method at each time step. Notably,\\nit maintains a significant advantage in both short-term and long-\\nterm spatio-temporal prediction, demonstrating the robustness\\nof our proposed model in cross-city prediction scenarios.\\n\u2022Effective Knowledge Transfer Across Cities : The prediction\\nresults obtained from the CHI-taxi dataset validate the supe-\\nrior forecasting capabilities of our model in cross-city scenarios.\\nThis enhancement can be attributed to the integration of spatio-\\ntemporal encoders with the spatio-temporal instruction-tuning\\nparadigm. By incorporating these components, our model ef-\\nfectively captures universal and transferable spatio-temporal\\npatterns, allowing it to make accurate predictions. Additionally,\\nby considering different geographical information and temporal\\nfactors alongside the learned transferred knowledge, our model\\nsuccessfully associates spatio-temporal patterns exhibited by\\nsimilar functional areas and historical periods. This comprehen-\\nsive understanding provides valuable insights for making precise\\nzero-shot predictions in cross-city scenarios.\\n4.3 Classical Supervised Prediction Task (RQ2)\\nThis section examines the predictive capabilities of our UrbanGPT\\nin end-to-end supervised prediction scenarios, as presented in Ta-\\nble 2. We will discuss the results from two perspectives below.\\nEnhanced Long-Term Forecasting Abilities : We examined the\\nmodel\u2019s effectiveness in long-term spatio-temporal forecasting by\\nutilizing test datasets that spanned broader time intervals. For in-\\nstance, we trained the model using data from 2017 and evaluated its\\nperformance on data from 2021. The results of these experiments\\ndemonstrate that our UrbanGPT possesses a significant advantage\\nover the baselines, highlighting its superior ability to generalize\\nacross different temporal landscapes. This capability reduces the\\nneed for frequent retraining or incremental updates, making the\\nmodel more aligned with real-world applications. Additionally, the\\nexperiments have confirmed that incorporating additional textual\\nknowledge does not hinder model performance or introduce noise,\\nthus further validating the feasibility of utilizing large language\\nmodels to enhance spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.\\nSpatial Semantic Understanding : Accurately capturing spatial\\ncorrelations is crucial in the realm of spatio-temporal prediction.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 7\\n\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon23456 MAE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOurs\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon3456789101112131415 RMSE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOurs\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon12345 MAE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOurs\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon456789101112131415 RMSE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOursFigure 4: Time step-based prediction comparison experiment conducted on the CHI-taxi dataset.\\nTable 2: Evaluation of performance in the end-to-end super-\\nvised setting on the NYC-taxi and NYC-bike datasets.\\nModelNYC-taxi NYC-bike\\nInflow Outflow Inflow Outflow\\nMAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE\\nAGCRN 2.83 8.35 2.62 9.21 3.30 7.65 3.38 7.73\\nASTGCN 5.41 18.04 5.00 19.29 3.87 7.93 3.66 7.69\\nGWN 3.91 11.93 2.89 10.85 4.30 9.04 3.88 8.29\\nMTGNN 3.09 10.13 2.61 10.96 3.31 7.47 3.26 7.61\\nSTWA 3.90 12.64 3.15 11.32 4.23 9.07 4.18 9.18\\nSTSGCN 4.57 13.93 4.41 15.87 5.10 12.23 4.72 10.78\\nSTGCN 3.45 9.82 3.17 10.53 3.88 9.23 3.90 9.08\\nTGCN 3.99 11.47 3.31 11.58 4.12 7.92 4.11 7.84\\nDMVSTNET 3.83 11.55 2.76 9.88 3.71 7.95 3.69 7.92\\nST-LSTM 7.78 15.41 6.92 17.12 5.00 11.52 4.96 11.41\\nUrbanGPT 2.50 6.78 1.71 6.68 3.11 7.10 3.01 6.94\\nTraditional methods often employ graph networks or attention\\nmechanisms to analyze these correlations.

This approach enables the model to comprehend the\\nshared characteristics of areas with similar functions at a higher\\nsemantic level. Consequently, it deduces patterns of correlation\\nbetween various functional zones and effectively represents the\\ninterconnections among different regions.\\n4.4 Ablation study (RQ3)\\nThis section investigates the impact of different key components\\non the performance of our model, as illustrated in Figure 5. Our\\nrigorous testing primarily revolves around the zero-shot scenario\\nusing the NYC-taxi dataset. Through our analysis, we have distilled\\nthe benefits offered by the different modules into four key points.\\n\u2022(1) Impact of Spatial and Temporal Context :-STC . By re-\\nmoving time and spatial information from the instruction text,\\nwe observed a noticeable decline in the model\u2019s performance.\\nThis can be attributed to the lack of temporal information, forcing\\nthe model to rely solely on spatio-temporal encoders for encoding\\ntime-related features and performing prediction tasks. Furthermore,\\nthe absence of spatial information hindered the model\u2019s ability to\\ncapture spatial correlations, making it challenging to analyze the\\ndistinct spatio-temporal patterns of different areas.\\n\u2022(2) Impact of Instruction-Tuning with Diverse Datasets :-\\nMulti .

As a result, the model\u2019s per-\\nformance was suboptimal. By integrating diverse spatio-temporal\\ndata from multiple sources, our model can effectively capture the\\nunique characteristics of different geographical locations and their\\nevolving spatio-temporal patterns.\\n\u2022(3) Impact of Spatio-Temporal Encoder :-STE . In this vari-\\nant, we disable the spatio-temporal encoder to investigate its\\neffect on aligning the large language model with encoded urban\\ndependency dynamics into latent embedding space.\\nThe results clearly indicate that the absence of the spatio-temporal\\nencoder significantly hampers the performance of the large lan-\\nguage model in spatio-temporal prediction scenarios. This under-\\nscores the crucial role played by the proposed spatio-temporal\\nencoder in enhancing the model\u2019s predictive capabilities.\\n\u2022(4) Regression Layer Incorporation in Instruction-Tuning:\\nT2P. We explicitly instructed UrbanGPT to generate its predic-\\ntions in a textual format. However, the suboptimal performance\\nindicates the challenges in utilizing LLMs for precise numerical\\nregression tasks, as opposed to employing regression layers.\\nThe primary challenge stems from the model\u2019s dependence on\\nmulti-class loss for optimization during training, leading to a mis-\\nmatch between the model\u2019s probabilistic output and the continuous\\nvalue distribution necessary for spatio-temporal forecasting. To\\nbridge this gap, we incorporated a regression predictor into our\\nmodel, significantly improving its capacity to generate more precise\\nnumerical predictions for regression tasks.\\n4.5 Model Robustness Study (RQ4)\\nIn this section, we focus on evaluating the robustness of our Ur-\\nbanGPT across different spatio-temporal pattern scenarios. We cate-\\ngorize regions based on the magnitude of numerical variations, such\\nas taxi flow, during a specific time period. Lower variance indicates\\nstable temporal patterns, while higher variance suggests diverse\\nspatio-temporal patterns in active commercial zones or densely\\npopulated areas.

Deep spatio-temporal\\nprediction methods have gained prominence in deep learning due\\nto their impressive performance. These models typically consist of\\ntwo components: temporal dependency modeling and spatial corre-\\nlation encoding. Early models like D-LSTM [ 43] and ST-resnet [ 45]\\nused RNNs and convolutional networks to model temporal and\\nspatial dependencies. Graph neural networks (GNNs) proved to\\nbe a natural fit for spatial correlation modeling, as seen in models\\nlike STGCN [ 42] and DCRNN [ 14], which utilized graph structures\\nbased on node distances. Techniques such as learnable region-wise\\ngraph structures [ 36,37] and dynamic spatio-temporal graph net-\\nworks [9, 48] have further enhanced spatial correlation modeling.\\nFurthermore, researchers have explored approaches such as\\nmulti-scale temporal learning [ 34] and multi-granularity tempo-\\nral learning [ 8] to encode temporal dependencies. These strategies\\nenable the capture of features like long-term and short-term correla-\\ntions as well as periodicity. These advancements have significantlycontributed to the progress of spatio-temporal prediction. However,\\nit is worth noting that the majority of these studies are tailored\\nfor supervised contexts, with limited research and development\\nfocused on zero-shot spatio-temporal forecasting. This represents\\nan important area that requires further exploration.\\nSpatio-Temporal Pre-training . Spatio-temporal pre-training tech-\\nniques have recently received significant research attention. These\\ntechniques primarily focus on generative [ 16,24] and contrastive [ 46]\\npre-training models to enhance the predictive performance of down-\\nstream tasks. There has also been extensive exploration of pretrain-\\nfinetune frameworks for few-shot learning scenarios [ 13,19], aim-\\ning to improve knowledge transferability by aligning source and\\ntarget data. However, these approaches require training or fine-\\ntuning on target data and lack zero-shot prediction capabilities. In\\nthis work, we address the challenge of data scarcity in downstream\\nurban scenarios by proposing UrbanGPT. Our model demonstrates\\nthe ability to generalize well across various scenarios, mitigating\\nthe need for extensive training or fine-tuning on target data.\\nLarge Language Models. The emergence of large language mod-\\nels [3,21] has recently attracted significant attention due to their\\nunprecedented machine performance in tasks like text understand-\\ning and reasoning. These models have become a hot topic, demon-\\nstrating the potential to advance from intelligent algorithms to\\nartificial intelligence. Open-source large language models such as\\nLlama [ 28,29], Vicuna [ 50], and ChatGLM [ 44] have been released,\\nleading to researchers exploring their application in various fields\\nto enhance transfer learning capabilities with domain knowledge\\nfrom these models. In the computer vision domain, researchers\\nhave combined multimodal large language models with prompt\\nlearning methods to achieve zero-shot predictions in downstream\\ntasks [ 25,51,52]. Furthermore, the capabilities of LLMs in graph\\nreasoning [ 2,4,27], recommendation [ 10,23,35] and traffic anal-\\nysis [ 6] have been extensively studied. However, the utilization\\nof large language models for zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction\\ntasks in the field of urban intelligence remains largely unexplored.\\n6 CONCLUSION\\nWe present the UrbanGPT, a spatio-temporal large language model,\\nto generalize well in diverse urban scenarios. To seamlessly align\\nthe spatio-temporal contextual signals with LLMs, we introduce a\\nspatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm. This empowers the\\nUrbanGPT with the remarkable ability to learn universal and trans-\\nferable spatio-temporal patterns across various types of urban data.\\nThrough extensive experiments and meticulous ablation studies,\\nwe demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of the UrbanGPT\u2019s\\narchitecture and its key components. However, it is important to\\nacknowledge that while the results are promising, there are still\\nlimitations to be addressed in future studies. As a first step, we are\\nactively engaged in collecting a more diverse range of urban data\\nto enhance and refine the capabilities of our UrbanGPT across a\\nbroader spectrum of urban computing domains. Additionally, un-\\nderstanding the decision-making process of our UrbanGPT is of im-\\nportance. While the model demonstrates exceptional performance,\\nproviding interpretability and explainability is equally essential.\\nFuture research efforts will focus on empowering our model with\\nthe ability to interpret and explain its predictions.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 9\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n[1]Lei Bai, Lina Yao, Can Li, Xianzhi Wang, and Can Wang. 2020.

This includes detailed dataset informa-\\ntion, hyperparameter configuration, experimental setting for the\\ninstruction-tuning phase and test phase, as well as the baselines.\\nFurthermore, we present a case study of our UrbanGPT, showcasing\\nits effectiveness for zero-shot spatio-temporal predictions.\\nA.1 Experimental Details Description\\nA.1.1 Dataset Details. We collected data on taxi flows, bicycle\\nflows, and crime incidents in New York City for training and evalu-\\nation. The NYC-taxi dataset contains 263 regions, with each region\\nmeasuring approximately 3km x 3km. The time sampling inter-\\nval for this dataset is 30 minutes. The NYC-bike and NYC-crime\\ndatasets consist of 2162 regions, each represented by a 1km x 1km\\ngrid. The time sampling interval for NYC-bike is also 30 minutes,\\nwhile for NYC-crime, it is 1 day. All datasets cover the time period\\nfrom Jan 1, 2016, to Dec 31, 2021, in NYC. The CHI-taxi dataset\\nincludes 77 regions, with each region measuring approximately\\n4km x 4km. This dataset includes all taxi data from January 1, 2021,\\nto December 31, 2021, with a time sampling interval of 30 minutes.\\nA.1.2 Hyperparameters Settings. The parameters for the di-\\nlation convolution kernel in the time encoder are set as follows:\\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b,\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61, and\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61are all set to 32, with a dilation factor of 1. For\\nour prediction task, we aim to predict the next 12 steps of data\\nbased on the previous 12 steps. Both the history length ( \ud835\udc3b) and\\nprediction length ( \ud835\udc43) are set to 12. The projection layer parameters\\nare configured with \ud835\udc51set to 64 and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3fset to 4096. Lastly, the hidden\\nlayer parameter \ud835\udc51\u2032for the regression layer is set to 128.\\nA.1.3 Further Experimental Setup Descriptions. During the\\ninstruction-tuning phase, we randomly selected 80 regions from\\nthe three datasets in New York City as training data. It\u2019s important\\nto note that the region indices were kept consistent for the NYC-\\nbike and NYC-crime datasets. The training sets had specific time\\nintervals: for NYC-taxi datasets, it ranged from January 1, 2017,\\nto March 31, 2017; for NYC-bike datasets, it covered April 1, 2017,\\nto June 30, 2017; and for NYC-crime datasets, it spanned from\\nJanuary 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018. For the pretraining of the\\nspatio-temporal dependency encoder and the baseline models, we\\nutilized the same data for training to optimize the parameters. The\\nmaximum epoch count was set at 100. In the testing phase, we\\nconducted the following evaluations:\\n\u2022(i)Zero-Shot Prediction . We also selected an additional 80\\nregions from the New York City datasets as unseen test data. For\\nthe NYC-bike and NYC-taxi datasets, we used the first two weeks\\nof data in 2020 for testing. As for the NYC-crime dataset, we used\\nthe entire year of 2020 for testing. In the case of the Chicago city\\ndataset, we evaluated the model using all the data from Dec 2021.\\n\u2022(ii)Classical Supervised Prediction : For evaluation purposes,\\nwe chose the data with the longest time interval, which involved\\ntesting the model using all the data from the NYC-bike and NYC-\\ntaxi datasets specifically for the month of December 2021.\\nA.1.4 Baseline Details. To facilitate our discussion, we have\\ncategorized all the baselines into three distinct categories: RNN-\\nbased models, attention-based models, and graph neural network(GNN)-based spatio-temporal prediction models. Below, we provide\\ndetailed descriptions of each baseline category:\\nRNN-based Spatio-Temporal Methods:\\n\u2022ST-LSTM [33]: It incorporates the Long Short-Term Memory to\\ncapture temporal dependencies in the spatio-temporal data.\\n\u2022AGCRN [1]: RNNs are employed to capture temporal correlations,\\nallowing for the representation of the evolving patterns over time.\\n\u2022DMVSTNET [39]: In this method, RNNs are utilized to effectively\\nmodel temporal dependencies, capturing the patterns that evolve\\nover time. Furthermore, convolutional networks and fully con-\\nnected layers are employed to capture local spatial correlations\\nand establish meaningful spatial relationships.\\nAttention-based Spatio-Temporal Approaches:\\n\u2022ASTGCN [8]: In this method, attention mechanisms are employed\\nto capture multi-granularity temporal correlation features.\\n\u2022STWA [5]: The model incorporates personalized temporal and\\nspatial parameters into the attention module, allowing for the\\nmodeling of dynamic spatio-temporal correlations.\\nSpatio-Temporal GNNs:\\n\u2022GWN [37]: It incorporates a learnable graph structure and 1-D\\nconvolutions to effectively learn spatio-temporal dependencies.\\n\u2022MTGNN [36]: It utilizes a learnable graph structure to model\\nmultivariate temporal correlations. MTGNN employs 1-D dilation\\nconvolutions to generate temporal representations.\\n\u2022TGCN [47]: This model combines graph neural networks (GNNs)\\nfor spatial correlation modeling and recurrent neural networks\\n(RNNs) for temporal correlation modeling.\\n\u2022STGCN [42]: It uses gated temporal convolutions and GNNs to\\nmodel temporal and spatial dependencies, respectively.\\n\u2022STSGCN [26]: It introduces a spatio-temporal graph construction\\nto learn spatial correlations across adjacent time steps.\\nA.2 Case study\\nIn this section, we assess the effectiveness of different large lan-\\nguage models (LLMs) in zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction sce-\\nnarios, as illustrated in Table 3 and Table 4. The instructions pro-\\nvided to the models are clearly indicated in blue font. The results\\ndemonstrate that various LLMs are capable of generating predic-\\ntions based on these instructions, thereby highlighting the effective-\\nness of the prompt design. For instance, ChatGPT relies on historical\\naverages rather than explicitly incorporating temporal or spatial\\ndata in its predictions. Llama-2-70b analyzes specific time periods\\nand regions, but it encounters challenges in encoding numerical\\ntime-series dependencies, resulting in suboptimal predictive perfor-\\nmance. On the other hand, Claude-2.1 effectively summarizes and\\nanalyzes historical data, leveraging peak-hour patterns and points\\nof interest to achieve more accurate traffic trend predictions.\\nOur proposed UrbanGPT seamlessly integrates spatio-temporal\\ncontextual signals with the reasoning capabilities of large language\\nmodels (LLMs) through a spatio-temporal instruction-tuning para-\\ndigm. This integration leads to remarkable improvements in predict-\\ning numerical values and spatio-temporal trends. These findings\\nunderscore the potential and effectiveness of our framework in\\ncapturing universal spatio-temporal patterns, making zero-shot\\nspatio-temporal prediction practical and achievable.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 11\\n\\nTable 3: We examine the zero-shot predictions of different LLMs for bicycle flow in NYC with the provided instructions.\\nInstructions: Given the historical data for bike flow over 12 time steps in a specific region of New York City, the recorded bike inflows\\nare [12 8 9 15 10 12 14 9 6 12 25 20], and the recorded bike outflows are [5 12 12 15 10 11 6 9 4 6 10 15]. The recording time of the\\nhistorical data is \u2019January 14, 2020, 12:00, Tuesday to January 14, 2020, 17:30, Tuesday, with data points recorded at 30-minute intervals\u2019.\\nHere is the region information: This region is located within the Staten Island borough district and encompasses various POIs within a\\none-kilometer radius, covering Education Facility, Cultural Facility, Commercial, Transportation Facility categories. We now aim to\\npredict the bike inflow and outflow for the next 12 time steps during the time period of \u2019January 14, 2020, 18:00, Tuesday to January 14,\\n2020, 23:30, Tuesday, with data points recorded at 30-minute intervals\u2019. To improve prediction accuracy, a spatio-temporal model is\\nutilized to encode the historical bike data as tokens <ST_Start><ST_HIS><ST_HIS><ST_End>, where the first and the second tokens\\ncorrespond to the representations of bike inflow and outflow. Please conduct an analysis of the traffic patterns in this region, taking into\\naccount the provided time and regional information, and then generate the predictions (the predictive tokens for regression).\\nGround true: Based on the given information, the predictions of bike inflow and outflow in this region are [26 38 28 24 20 13 16 9 5 3\\n5 2] and[12 19 10 10 11 9 6 5 4 4 2 2] .\\nLlama-2-70b Responds: Based on the provided historical data, I have ... Here are my predictions for the bike inflow and outflow for the\\nnext 12 time steps:Bike Inflow: [15 18 20 15 12 10 14 12 10 15 18 20] . Bike Outflow: [10 12 15 10 11 12 10 9 6 10 12 15] .\\nThese predictions are based on the following analysis: Time of Day: The traffic patterns during this time are likely to be influenced by\\nthe evening rush hour, with increased bike inflows and outflows during the peak hours...Regional Information: ... This suggests that\\nthere may be a mix of both commuter and recreational bike traffic in the area...\\nChatGPT Responds: To analyze the traffic patterns in the given region and make predictions for the next 12 time steps, we can calculate\\nthe average bike inflow and outflow based on the historical data... Now, we can generate predictions for the next 12 time steps: Predicted\\nBike Inflow: [11.67 11.67... 11.67] . Predicted Bike Outflow: [9.58 9.58... 9.58] ...\\nClaude-2.1 Responds: Based on the provided historical data, this region in Staten Island seems to experience fluctuating yet relatively\\nlow bike traffic flow during the daytime on Tuesdays. The bike inflows range from 6 to 15 per 30-minute interval, while outflows range\\nfrom 4 to 15.Given the region covers education, cultural, commercial, and transportation facilities within a 1km radius, the bike traffic\\nlikely corresponds to people traveling to and from these points of interest. The fluctuations could reflect class/work schedules and\\ntransportation needs throughout the day.For the evening prediction period of 6PM to 11:30PM, we may expect some further fluctuations\\nbut generally declining bike traffic as the day turns to night. People would be finishing up activities and heading home. I would predict\\nthe following bike inflows and outflows for the next 12 time steps: [10 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 1 1] and[8 6 5 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 1 1] ...\\nUrbanGPT Responds: Based on the given information, the predictions (predicted tokens) of bike inflow and outflow in this region are\\n<ST_PRE> [20 21 22 21 17 12 9 7 6 5 5 5] and <ST_PRE> [11 10 8 7 6 6 5 4 4 3 3 2] .\\nTable 4: Zero-shot predictions of different LLMs for taxi flow in NYC with the provided instructions (without spatial information).\\nInstructions: Given the historical data for taxi flow over 12 time steps in a specific region of New York City, the recorded taxi inflows\\nare [111 86 90 78 49 75 46 32 20 14 9 9], and the recorded taxi outflows are [100 91 58 39 47 47 19 22 21 9 16 10]. The recording time of the\\nhistorical data is \u2019January 5, 2020, 20:30, Sunday to January 6, 2020, 02:00, Monday, with data points recorded at 30-minute intervals\u2019. No\\ndescription is available for this region. Now we want to predict the taxi inflow and outflow for the next 12 time steps during the time\\nperiod of \u2019January 6, 2020, 02:30, Monday to January 6, 2020, 08:00, Monday, with data points recorded at 30-minute intervals\u2019...\\nGround true: Based on the given information, the predictions of taxi inflow and outflow in this region are [9 3 3 4 6 3 30 22 58 74 91\\n110] and[5 10 7 15 11 19 43 46 90 146 213 187] .\\nLlama-2-70b Responds: Based on the provided historical data, I have analyzed the traffic patterns...

The predictions are based on the following factors...\\nChatGPT Responds: To generate predictions for the next 12 time steps, we can use the average values as a baseline...Predicted taxi\\ninflows: [53.33 53.33... 53.33] . Predicted taxi outflows: [40.83 40.83... 40.83] ...\\nClaude-2.1 Responds: The data covers evening hours on a Sunday and early morning hours on a Monday. We can expect lower taxi\\ndemand during later Sunday evening, with some pickup around end-of-weekend times and early Monday commute times. The region\\nis unspecified, so we cannot infer any location-specific usage patterns. Inflow ranges from 49-111 taxis over the 30 minute intervals.\\nOutflow ranges from 19-100 taxis. This indicates the region likely serves both residential and commercial purposes.\\nPrediction: Inflows: [25 15 10 8 7 9 15 25 35 40 45 50] .

This has significant implications in the field\\nof urban computing, where the ability to predict transportation\\npatterns can optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance\\noverall urban mobility [ 18,31]. Moreover, anticipating population\\nmovement can aid in effective urban planning and resource alloca-\\ntion [ 7,20]. Additionally, the ability to forecast crimes can greatly\\ncontribute to enhancing public safety [ 32]. Spatio-temporal predic-\\ntion plays a vital role in shaping smarter and more efficient cities,\\nultimately leading to an improved quality of urban life.\\nIt is important to highlight the various types of neural network\\narchitectures commonly adopted in this domain of spatio-temporal\\nprediction. These architectures are designed to capture and model\\nthe complex relationships between spatial and temporal dimensions\\nin the data. One widely employed architecture is the Convolutional\\nNeural Network (CNN) [ 15,39,45], which is effective in extract-\\ning spatial features by applying convolutional filters across the\\ninput data. Another line of spatio-temporal neural networks is the\\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) family [ 1,34,43]. Those spatio-\\ntemporal RNNs are well-suited for capturing temporal dependencies\\nby maintaining a memory state that can retain information over\\ntime. Recently, there has been a surge in the use of Graph Neural\\nNetworks (GNNs) for spatio-temporal prediction [ 36,40,47]. GNNs\\nexcel in modeling complex spatial relationships in data represented\\nas graphs, where each node corresponds to a spatial location and\\nedges capture the connections between them.\\nWhile current spatio-temporal neural network techniques have\\nproven to be highly effective, it is crucial to acknowledge their\\nstrong dependence on having an abundance of labeled data in order\\nto generate accurate predictions. However, the pervasive problem\\nof data scarcity in practical urban sensing scenarios poses a sig-\\nnificant challenge. For example, deploying sensors throughout the\\nentire urban space to monitor citywide traffic volume or air qual-\\nity is impractical due to the high cost involved [ 17,41]. Moreover,\\nthe challenge of limited labeled data availability extends to spatio-\\ntemporal forecasting across different cities, in which acquiring\\nlabeled data for each target city becomes a daunting task [ 13,38].\\nThese issues emphasize the pressing need for novel solutions that\\naddress data scarcity and enhance the generalization capabilities of\\nspatio-temporal models in various smart city applications.\\nInspired by the remarkable progress of large language models\\n(LLMs), our primary goal is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that\\npossesses outstanding generalization capabilities across a wide\\narray of urban tasks. Leveraging the reasoning abilities inherent in\\nLLMs, we aim to expand their success into the domain of spatio-\\ntemporal analysis. Our objective is to develop a model that can\\neffectively comprehend and forecast intricate spatial and temporal\\npatterns, enabling it to excel in various urban scenarios.\\nWhile it is of utmost importance to develop a versatile spatio-\\ntemporal model capable of effectively handling diverse downstreamarXiv:2403.00813v3  [cs.CL]  19 May 2024\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 2\\n\\nInstruction s:Given thehistorical data fortaxiflow over 12time steps inaspecific region ofNew York City, the\\nrecorded taxiinflows are[9194100 939376676650695542],and therecorded taxioutflows are[9691108\\n10283787674106938657]\u2026Please predict thetaxiinflow and outflow fornext 12time steps\u2026\\nLabel s:Taxi Inflow :[5536333033273714167512]Taxi Outflow :[547069593231292120111312].\\nOurs :Based onthegiven information, thepredictions oftaxiinflow and outflow inthisregion are\u2026\\nPrediction :Inflow :[514845424038332824211816]Outflow :[544945413835302521181614].\\nHuman\\nInstructions\\nLLAMA -70BGround true\\nPrediction :Inflow :[282827262524232323232424]Outflow :[343128252219171616151515] Baseline\\nLLM :There isanoticeable spike intaxiinflows and outflows around 10:00-11:00,which may indicate asurge in\\ndemand fortaxiservices\u2026Ihave created apredictive model toforecast thetaxiflow forthenext 12time steps :\\nPrediction :Inflow :[53586460677378849196102 108]Outflow :[5661687379848995102 107 113 119]\\nUrbanGPT\\n2 4 6 8 10 12\\nTime Steps020406080100 Inflow Predicted valueBaseline\\nLLM\\nOurs\\nGround_true\\n2 4 6 8 10 12\\nTime Steps020406080100120 Outflow Predicted valueBaseline\\nLLM\\nOurs\\nGround_trueFigure 1: The superior predictive performance of the pro-\\nposed UrbanGPT compared to the large language model\\n(LLaMA-70B) and the spatiotemporal graph neural network\\n(STGCN) in a zero-shot traffic flow prediction scenario.\\ntasks, aligning the spatio-temporal context with the knowledge\\nspace of large language models (LLMs) and enabling them to com-\\nprehend the complex dependencies across time and space present\\nsignificant challenges. These hurdles call for meticulous model\\ndesign to bridge the gap between the unique characteristics of\\nspatio-temporal data and the knowledge encoded within LLMs.\\nContributions . In light of these challenges, we propose UrbanGPT,\\na large language model specifically tailored for spatio-temporal\\nprediction. At the core of UrbanGPT lies a novel spatio-temporal\\ninstruction-tuning paradigm that seeks to align the intricate de-\\npendencies of time and space, with the knowledge space of LLMs.\\nWithin our UrbanGPT framework, we start by incorporating a\\nspatio-temporal dependency encoder, which utilizes a multi-level\\ntemporal convolutional network. This encoder enables the model\\nto capture the intricate temporal dynamics present in the spatio-\\ntemporal data across various time resolutions. Then, our model\\ninvolves aligning textual and spatio-temporal information to em-\\npower language models in effectively injecting spatio-temporal\\ncontextual signals. This is achieved through the utilization of a\\nlightweight alignment module that projects the representations\\nof spatio-temporal dependencies. The result is the generation of\\nmore expressive semantic representations by integrating valuable\\ninformation from both textual and spatio-temporal domains.\\nThrough the incorporation of spatio-temporal information dur-\\ning the instruction-tuning process, the language model gains profi-\\nciency in understanding and processing the intricate relationships\\nand patterns found in spatio-temporal data. By leveraging the in-\\nsights obtained from the spatio-temporal domain, the language\\nmodel becomes better equipped to capture the nuances and com-\\nplexities of spatio-temporal phenomena. This, in turn, enables the\\nmodel to make more reliable and insightful predictions across vari-\\nous urban scenarios, even when faced with limited data availability.\\nTo showcase the superior predictive performance of our pro-\\nposed model, we compare it with the large language model (LLaMA-\\n70B) and the spatio-temporal graph neural network (STGCN) in azero-shot traffic flow prediction scenario guided by textual instruc-\\ntions, as depicted in Figure 1. The large language model, LLaMA,\\neffectively infers traffic patterns from the input text. However, its\\nlimitations in handling numeric time-series data with complex spa-\\ntial and temporal dependencies can sometimes lead to opposite\\ntraffic trend predictions. On the other hand, the pre-trained base-\\nline model demonstrates a strong understanding of spatio-temporal\\ndependencies. However, it may suffer from overfitting to the source\\ndataset and underperform in zero-shot scenarios, indicating its lim-\\nited generalization capabilities beyond existing spatio-temporal\\nprediction models. In contrast, our proposed model achieves a har-\\nmonious integration of domain-specific spatio-temporal knowledge\\nand language modeling capabilities. This enables us to make more\\naccurate and reliable predictions under data scarcity.\\nIn summary, our main contributions can be outlined as follows:\\n\u2022To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop\\na spatio-temporal large language model capable of predicting\\ndiverse urban phenomena across different datasets, especially\\nunder conditions of limited data availability.\\n\u2022We propose UrbanGPT, a spatio-temporal prediction framework\\nthat empowers large language models (LLMs) to comprehend\\nthe intricate inter-dependencies across time and space. This is\\nachieved through the seamless integration of a spatio-temporal\\ndependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm, ef-\\nfectively aligning the spatio-temporal context with LLMs.\\n\u2022Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets\\nprovide compelling evidence of our proposed UrbanGPT\u2019s excep-\\ntional ability to generalize in zero-shot spatio-temporal learning\\nscenarios. These findings highlight the model\u2019s robust general-\\nization capacity, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately\\npredicting and understanding spatio-temporal patterns, even in\\nscenarios where no prior training data is available.\\n2 PRELIMINARIES\\nSpatio-Temporal Data . Spatio-temporal data is commonly col-\\nlected and can be represented as a three-dimensional tensor X\u2208\\nR\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc47\u00d7\ud835\udc39. Each element X\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udc53in the tensor corresponds to the value\\nof the\ud835\udc53-th feature at the \ud835\udc61-th time interval in the \ud835\udc5f-th region. To\\nprovide an example, let\u2019s consider predicting taxi traffic patterns in\\nan urban area. In this scenario, the data can represent the inflow\\nand outflow of taxis in a specific region ( e.g., the\ud835\udc5f-th spatial area)\\nduring a given time period from \ud835\udc61to\ud835\udc61\u22121(e.g., a 30-minute interval).\\nSpatio-Temporal Forecasting. In spatio-temporal prediction tasks,\\na common scenario involves forecasting future trends using histor-\\nical data. Specifically, the goal is to predict the data for the next \ud835\udc43\\ntime steps based on information from the preceding \ud835\udc3bsteps.\\nX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+\ud835\udc43=\ud835\udc53(X\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e\u2212\ud835\udc3b+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e) (1)\\nThe function \ud835\udc53(\u00b7)represents a spatio-temporal prediction model\\nthat has been trained effectively using historical data. Spatio-temporal\\nprediction tasks can be divided into two main categories: regression\\nprediction, which involves predicting continuous values like traffic\\nflow or taxi demand [ 22], and classification prediction, where the\\ngoal is to classify events such as crime occurrence prediction [ 11].\\nTo optimize the model \ud835\udc53(\u00b7), different loss functions are utilized\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 3\\n\\nbased on the specific characteristics of the spatio-temporal scenar-\\nios.\\nSpatio-Temporal Zero-Shot Learning . Despite the effectiveness\\nof current spatio-temporal learning approaches, they often en-\\ncounter difficulties in effectively generalizing across a wide range of\\ndownstream spatio-temporal learning scenarios. In this study, our\\nfocus is on addressing the challenge of spatio-temporal zero-shot\\nscenarios, where we aim to learn from previously unseen data in\\ndownstream spatio-temporal prediction datasets or tasks. This can\\nbe formally defined as follows:\\n\u02dcX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e+\ud835\udc43=\u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u02dcX\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e\u2212\ud835\udc3b+1:\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e) (2)\\nIn this particular scenario, the prediction function \u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u00b7)is responsi-\\nble for forecasting the spatio-temporal data \u02dcXfrom downstream\\ntasks that have not been previously encountered. It should be noted\\nthat the model \u02c6\ud835\udc53(\u00b7)is not trained specifically on the target data.\\n3 METHODOLOGY\\n3.1 Spatio-Temporal Dependency Encoder\\nAlthough large language models demonstrate exceptional profi-\\nciency in language processing, they face challenges in comprehend-\\ning the time-evolving patterns inherent in spatio-temporal data. To\\novercome this limitation, we propose enhancing the capability of\\nlarge language models to capture temporal dependencies within\\nspatio-temporal contexts. This is accomplished by integrating a\\nspatio-temporal encoder that incorporates a multi-level tempo-\\nral convolutional network. By doing so, we enable the model to\\neffectively capture the intricate temporal dependencies across vari-\\nous time resolutions, thereby improving its understanding of the\\ncomplex temporal dynamics present in the spatio-temporal data.\\nSpecifically, our spatio-temporal encoder is composed of two key\\ncomponents: a gated dilated convolution layer and a multi-level\\ncorrelation injection layer. Let\u2019s formalize this architecture as:\\n\u03a8(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f=(\u00afW(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc58\u2217E(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+\u00afb(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc58)\u00b7\ud835\udeff(\u00afW(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc54\u2217E(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+\u00afb(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc54)+E\u2032(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f (3)\\nWe begin with the initial spatio-temporal embedding, denoted as\\nE\ud835\udc5f\u2208R\ud835\udc47\u00d7\ud835\udc51. This embedding is obtained by enhancing the original\\ndata Xthrough a linear layer. To address the issue of gradient\\nvanishing, we utilize a slice of E\ud835\udc5f, denoted as E\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5f\u2208R\ud835\udc47\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51, which\\nis determined by the size of the dilated convolutional kernel. This\\nslice is employed for performing residual operations. To perform\\nthe residual operations, we use 1-D dilated convolution kernels\\n\u00afW\ud835\udc58and \u00afW\ud835\udc54\u2208R\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc54\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61, along with the corresponding bias\\nterms \u00afb\ud835\udc58and \u00afb\ud835\udc54\u2208R\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61. The sigmoid activation function \ud835\udeffis\\napplied to control the degree of information preservation during the\\nrepeated convolution operation. After the gated temporal dilated\\nconvolutional layer encoding, we are able to effectively capture the\\ntemporal dependencies across multiple time steps, resulting in the\\ngeneration of temporal representations.\\nThese representations contain different levels of temporal de-\\npendencies, reflecting various granularity-aware time-evolving pat-\\nterns. To preserve these informative patterns, we introduce a multi-\\nlevel correlation injection layer. This layer is designed to incorpo-\\nrate correlations between different levels and is formalized as:\\nS(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f=(W(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc60\u2217\u03a8(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc5f+b(\ud835\udc59)\\n\ud835\udc60)+S(\ud835\udc59\u22121)\\n\ud835\udc5f (4)We have the convolution kernel W\ud835\udc60\u2208R\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc46\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\u00d7\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61and the bias\\nvector b\ud835\udc60\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61. These are employed after \ud835\udc3flayers of encoding.\\nA simple non-linear layer is employed to merge the results from\\nequations 3 and 4, and the final spatio-temporal dependency repre-\\nsentations of are denoted as \u02dc\u03a8\u2208R\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc39\u00d7\ud835\udc51. To address the diverse\\nset of urban scenarios that may arise downstream, our proposed\\nspatio-temporal encoder is designed to be independent of graph\\nstructures when modeling spatial correlations. This is particularly\\ncrucial because in zero-shot prediction contexts, the spatial rela-\\ntionships between entities may be unknown or difficult to ascertain.\\nBy not relying on explicit graph structures, our encoder can effec-\\ntively handle a broad spectrum of urban scenarios, where spatial\\ncorrelations and dependencies can vary or be challenging to define\\nin advance. This flexibility enables our model to adapt and perform\\nwell, ensuring its applicability in a wide range of urban contexts.\\n3.2 Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning\\n3.2.1 Spatio-Temporal-Text Alignment. In order to enable lan-\\nguage models to effectively comprehend spatio-temporal patterns,\\nit is crucial to align textual and spatio-temporal information. This\\nalignment allows for the fusion of different modalities, resulting\\nin a more informative representation. By integrating contextual\\nfeatures from both textual and spatio-temporal domains, we can\\ncapture complementary information and extract higher-level se-\\nmantic representations that are more expressive and meaningful.\\nTo achieve this objective, we utilize a lightweight alignment mod-\\nule to project the spatio-temporal dependencies representations\\n\u02dc\u03a8. This projection involves the use of parameters W\ud835\udc5d\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f\\nandb\ud835\udc5d\u2208R\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, where\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3frepresents the commonly used hidden\\ndimension in language models (LLMs).\\nThe resulting projection, denoted as H\u2208R\ud835\udc45\u00d7\ud835\udc39\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, are rep-\\nresented in the instructions using special tokens as: <ST_start>,\\n<ST_HIS>, ..., <ST_HIS>, <ST_end>. Here, <ST_start> and <ST_end>\\nserve as identifiers marking the beginning and end of the spatio-\\ntemporal token. These identifiers can be included in the large-\\nscale language model by expanding its vocabulary. The placeholder\\n<ST_HIS> represents the spatio-temporal token and corresponds to\\nthe projection Hin the hidden layer. By employing this technique,\\nthe model gains the ability to discern spatio-temporal dependen-\\ncies, thereby enhancing its proficiency in successfully performing\\nspatio-temporal predictive tasks within urban scenes.\\n3.2.2 Spatio-Temporal Prompt Instructions. In scenarios in-\\nvolving spatio-temporal prediction, both temporal and spatial in-\\nformation contain valuable semantic details that contribute to the\\nmodel\u2019s understanding of spatio-temporal patterns within specific\\ncontexts. For instance, traffic flow in the early morning differs sig-\\nnificantly from rush hour, and there are variations in traffic patterns\\nbetween commercial and residential areas.

By incorporating these\\ndiverse elements, UrbanGPT is capable of identifying and assimi-\\nlating spatio-temporal patterns across different regions and time-\\nframes. This enables the model to encapsulate these insights within\\ncomplex spatio-temporal contexts, thereby enhancing its ability\\nfor zero-shot reasoning. The design of the instructional text for\\nspatio-temporal information is illustrated in Figure 3.\\n3.2.3 Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning of LLMs. When\\nit comes to incorporating detailed spatio-temporal textual descrip-\\ntions, the next stage is to fine-tune large language models (LLMs)\\nusing instructions to generate spatio-temporal forecasts in textual\\nformat. However, this approach poses two challenges. Firstly , spatio-\\ntemporal forecasting typically relies on numerical data, which dif-\\nfers in structure and patterns from natural language that language\\nmodels excel at processing, focusing on semantic and syntactic rela-\\ntionships. Secondly , large language models are typically pre-trained\\nusing a multi-classification loss to predict vocabulary, resulting in a\\nprobability distribution of potential outcomes. This contrasts with\\nthe continuous value distribution required for regression tasks.\\nTo address these challenges, UrbanGPT adopts a different strat-\\negy by refraining from directly predicting future spatio-temporal\\nvalues. Instead, it generates forecasting tokens that aid in the pre-\\ndiction process. These tokens are subsequently passed through a\\nregression layer, which maps the hidden representations to generate\\nmore accurate predictive values. The formulation of the regressionlayer in our spatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm is:\\n\u02c6Y\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53=W3[\ud835\udf0e(W1H\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53),\ud835\udf0e(W2\u0393\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53)] (5)\\nThe prediction result, denoted as \u02c6Y\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53\u2208R\ud835\udc43, is obtained using the\\nrectified linear unit activation function, represented by \ud835\udf0e. The hid-\\nden representations of the forecasting tokens, denoted as \u0393\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc53\u2208\\nR\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, are introduced as a novel term in the vocabulary of large lan-\\nguage models (LLMs). The regression layer is formulated using\\nweight matrices W1\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f,W2\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u2032\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3f, and W3\u2208R\ud835\udc43\u00d72\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n,\\nwhere[\u00b7,\u00b7]represents the concatenation operation. While the prob-\\nability distribution of the forecasting tokens remains relatively\\nstable, their hidden representations contain rich spatio-temporal\\ncontextual attributes that capture dynamic spatio-temporal interde-\\npendencies. This enables our model to provide precise predictions\\nby leveraging this contextual information.\\n3.3 Model Optimization\\nBuilding upon the baseline model [ 1,8], we adopt the absolute error\\nloss as our regression loss function. This choice allows us to effec-\\ntively handle predictions across a wide range of urban scenarios.\\nAdditionally, we introduce a classification loss as a joint loss to\\ncater to diverse task requirements. To ensure optimal performance,\\nour model optimizes different losses based on the specific task in-\\nputs. For instance, we utilize the regression loss for tasks such as\\ntraffic flow prediction, while employing the classification loss for\\ntasks like crime prediction. This approach enables our model to\\neffectively address the unique challenges posed by each task and\\ndeliver accurate predictions in various urban scenarios.\\nL\ud835\udc50=\u22121\\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01\\n\ud835\udc56=1[\ud835\udeff(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)\u00b7log(\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)+(1\u2212\ud835\udeff(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56))\u00b7log(1\u2212\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)]\\nL\ud835\udc5f=1\\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01\\n\ud835\udc56=1|\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\u2212\u02c6\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56|;L=L\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc60+L\ud835\udc5f+L\ud835\udc50 (6)\\nHere,\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56represents a sample from \u02c6Y, and\ud835\udc41represents the total\\nnumber of samples, which is calculated as the product of \ud835\udc45,\ud835\udc47, and\\n\ud835\udc39. We use various loss functions in our model, including L\ud835\udc50for\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 5\\n\\nbinary cross-entropy loss, L\ud835\udc5ffor regression loss, and the cross-\\nentropy loss adopted in our spatio-temporal language models. To\\ncapture probability distributions from the prediction, we employ\\nthe sigmoid function denoted by \ud835\udeff. Each of these loss functions\\nplays a specific role in our model, allowing us to effectively handle\\nclassification, regression, and language modeling tasks as needed.\\n4 EVALUATION\\nIn this section, we aim to assess the capabilities of our proposed\\nmodel across various settings by addressing five key questions:\\n\u2022RQ1 : What is the performance and generalization capability of\\nUrbanGPT in diverse zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction tasks?\\n\u2022RQ2 : How does UrbanGPT perform when compared to existing\\nspatio-temporal models in classical supervised scenarios?\\n\u2022RQ3 : What specific contributions do the proposed key compo-\\nnents bring to enhance the capabilities of our UrbanGPT model?\\n\u2022RQ4 : Can the proposed model robustly handle the forecasting\\nscenarios with varying spatio-temporal patterns?\\n4.1 Experimental Setting\\n4.1.1 Dataset Description. To evaluate the effectiveness of the\\nproposed model in predicting spatio-temporal patterns across var-\\nious urban computing scenarios, we conducted experiments us-\\ning four distinct datasets: NYC-taxi, NYC-bike, NYC-crime, and\\nCHI-taxi. These datasets encompass a wide range of data sources\\nto capture the dynamic nature of urban environments, including\\nrecords of taxi travel, bike trajectories, crime incidents in New York\\nCity, and taxi travel data in Chicago. To facilitate our analysis, we\\npartitioned the cities into grid-like regions based on latitude and\\nlongitude information. Within specific time intervals, we aggre-\\ngated statistical measures for each region. For example, this in-\\nvolved calculating the number of taxi inflows and outflows within\\na 30-minute period in region A, or determining the count of theft\\nincidents within a day in region B. Furthermore, Points of Interest\\n(POIs) data can be obtained through APIs provided by map services,\\nutilizing the latitude and longitude of different regions. For more\\ncomprehensive data descriptions, please refer to the Appendix.\\n4.1.2 Evaluation Protocols. In order to investigate the capabili-\\nties of large language models in analyzing diverse spatio-temporal\\ndata across different regions, we selected a subset of taxi, bike, and\\ncrime data from various areas of New York City as our training set.\\n\u2022Zero-Shot Learning Scenarios . We assessed the model perfor-\\nmance by predicting future spatio-temporal data from regions in\\nNYC or even Chicago that were unseen in the training phase.\\n\u2022Supervised Learning Scenarios . We evaluated the model using\\nfuture data from the same regions as the training set.\\nFor regression tasks, we maintained a consistent training and test-\\ning methodology across all baseline models. When it came to classi-\\nfication tasks involving crime data, we utilized binary cross-entropy\\nas the loss function for training and testing the models. Our ex-\\nperiments were conducted using the robust vicuna-7b [ 50] as the\\nfoundational large language model for UrbanGPT. For a more com-\\nprehensive understanding of our methodology and experimental\\nsetup, please refer to the appendix for detailed information.4.1.3 Evaluation Metrics. For regression tasks, we employed\\nMAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)\\nas evaluation metrics. These metrics quantify the discrepancies\\nbetween the predicted outcomes and the actual labels, with lower\\nvalues indicating superior performance [ 12,49]. In the case of clas-\\nsification tasks, we utilized Recall and Macro-F1 as evaluation met-\\nrics to assess performance. Recall measures the model\u2019s ability to\\ncorrectly identify positive instances, while Macro-F1 is a compre-\\nhensive performance metric that combines precision and recall to\\nprovide an overall measure of classification accuracy [11, 30].\\n4.1.4 Baseline Model. We conducted a thorough comparison\\nwith 10 advanced models to establish baselines for our proposed\\nmethod. (i)In the category of RNNs-based spatio-temporal forecast-\\ning methods, we compared our proposed method with AGCRN [ 1],\\nDMVSTNET [ 39] and ST-LSTM [ 33]. These approaches leverage\\nRNNs for modeling and prediction. (ii)The GNNs-based spatio-\\ntemporal models primarily utilize graph neural networks to cap-\\nture spatial correlations and integrate temporal encoders to capture\\nspatio-temporal relationships. The models we compared against\\nin this category include GWN [ 37], MTGNN [ 36], STSGCN [ 26],\\nTGCN [ 47], and STGCN [ 42].(iii) In the attention-based spatio-\\ntemporal models category, the methods employ attention mecha-\\nnisms to model spatio-temporal correlations. The models we com-\\npared against in this category are ASTGCN [8] and STWA [5].\\n4.2 Zero-Shot Prediction Performance (RQ1)\\nIn this section, we thoroughly evaluate the predictive performance\\nof our proposed model in zero-shot scenarios. The results of our\\nevaluation are presented in Table 1 and visualized in Figure 4. Our\\nobjective is to assess the model\u2019s effectiveness in predicting spatio-\\ntemporal patterns in geographical areas that it has not encountered\\nduring training. This evaluation encompasses both cross-region\\nand cross-city settings, allowing us to gain insights into the model\u2019s\\ngeneralization capabilities across different locations.\\n4.2.1 Prediction on Unseen Regions within a City. Cross-\\nregion scenarios entail using data from certain regions within a\\ncity to forecast future conditions in other regions that have not\\nbeen encountered by the model. Through a thorough analysis of\\nthe model\u2019s performance in these cross-region predictions, we can\\ndraw attention to three significant observations:\\ni) Superior Zero-shot Predictive Performance . The results pre-\\nsented in Table 1 highlight the exceptional performance of our\\nproposed model in both regression and classification tasks on vari-\\nous datasets, surpassing the baseline models in zero-shot prediction.\\nThe success of our model can be attributed to two key factors.\\n\u2022Spatio-Temporal-Text-Alignment . The alignment of spatio-\\ntemporal contextual signals with the text comprehension abil-\\nities of language models plays a pivotal role in the success of\\nour proposed model. This fusion enables the model to effectively\\ncapitalize on both the encoded urban dynamics from the spa-\\ntiotemporal signals and the comprehensive understanding of\\ntextual context provided by the LLMs. By leveraging these two\\nessential aspects, our model achieves the remarkable ability to\\ngeneralize its prediction capabilities in zero-shot scenarios.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 6\\n\\nTable 1: Our model\u2019s performance in zero-shot prediction is evaluated on three diverse datasets: NYC-taxi, NYC-bike, and\\nNYC-crime, providing a comprehensive assessment of its predictive capabilities in unseen situations.\\nModelDataset NYC-taxi NYC-bike NYC-crime\\nType Inflow Outflow Inflow Outflow Burglary Robbery\\nMetrics MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE Macro-F1 Recall Macro-F1 Recall\\nAGCRN 10.86 26.51 13.15 36.45 3.41 7.98 3.42 8.08 0.48 0.00 0.49 0.01\\nASTGCN 9.75 24.12 12.42 33.28 5.58 11.58 5.78 12.29 0.49 0.01 0.55 0.09\\nGWN 10.73 26.50 9.67 26.74 3.32 8.17 3.07 7.52 0.48 0.00 0.52 0.04\\nMTGNN 10.16 25.84 12.59 35.38 3.18 7.62 3.20 7.65 0.64 0.27 0.65 0.30\\nSTWA 11.28 28.97 13.54 38.61 4.59 10.94 4.35 10.67 0.48 0.00 0.51 0.03\\nSTSGCN 18.97 41.38 20.07 45.79 6.85 14.98 6.54 14.77 0.48 0.00 0.48 0.00\\nSTGCN 12.54 30.80 14.32 39.58 4.11 9.21 4.45 9.62 0.48 0.00 0.64 0.30\\nTGCN 10.04 25.10 10.98 30.03 2.88 6.55 2.91 6.42 0.56 0.10 0.58 0.13\\nDMVSTNET 11.00 28.29 10.59 29.20 3.80 9.87 3.65 9.21 0.48 0.01 0.59 0.15\\nST-LSTM 16.97 34.43 18.93 44.10 7.78 15.41 6.92 17.12 0.48 0.00 0.49 0.03\\nUrbanGPT 6.16 16.92 6.83 21.78 2.02 5.16 2.01 5.03 0.67 0.34 0.69 0.42\\n\u2022Spatio-Temporal Instruction-Tuning . This adaptive tuning\\nprocess empowers the LLM to effectively integrate crucial in-\\nformation from the instructions, enhancing its comprehension\\nof the complex relationships and dependencies between spatial\\nand temporal factors. By seamlessly merging the spatio-temporal\\ninstruction-tuning with the spatio-temporal dependency encoder,\\nour proposed model, UrbanGPT, successfully preserves universal\\nand transferable spatio-temporal knowledge. Consequently, the\\nmodel becomes capable of capturing the fundamental patterns\\nand dynamics that govern spatio-temporal phenomena, enabling\\nit to make precise predictions in downstream zero-shot scenarios.\\nii) Enhanced Urban Semantic Understanding . Urban seman-\\ntics offer valuable insights into the diverse dimensions of spatial\\nand temporal characteristics. Our approach involves training our\\nmodel on a wide range of datasets, enriching its understanding\\nof spatio-temporal dynamics across different timeframes and geo-\\ngraphical locations. In contrast, baseline models tend to prioritize\\nencoding temporal and spatial dependencies, neglecting the nu-\\nanced semantics that differentiate regions, timeframes, and data\\ncategories. By incorporating comprehensive semantic awareness\\ninto our UrbanGPT, we significantly enhance its ability to make\\naccurate zero-shot predictions in previously unseen regions.\\niii) Improved Performance in Sparse Data Scenarios . Predict-\\ning spatio-temporal patterns in sparse data environments is chal-\\nlenging as models tend to overfit when data points are scarce. This\\nchallenge is particularly notable when predicting crimes, where data\\nis often sparse but crucial for accurate predictions. Baseline mod-\\nels struggle in cross-regional prediction tasks under these sparse\\nconditions, resulting in low recall scores that indicate potential over-\\nfitting. To overcome this limitation, our model integrates spatio-\\ntemporal learning with large language models (LLMs) using an\\neffective spatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm. By incorpo-\\nrating rich semantic insights, our approach enhances the model\u2019s\\nspatio-temporal representations, enabling it to effectively handle\\nsparse data and achieve improved prediction accuracy.\\n4.2.2 Cross-City Prediction Task. To assess the performance of\\nour model in cross-city prediction tasks, we conducted tests on the\\nCHI-taxi dataset, which was not seen during the training phase. The\\nresults, depicted in Figure 4, yielded the following observations:\u2022Consistency in Multi-step Prediction : Our model consistently\\noutperforms the comparison method at each time step. Notably,\\nit maintains a significant advantage in both short-term and long-\\nterm spatio-temporal prediction, demonstrating the robustness\\nof our proposed model in cross-city prediction scenarios.\\n\u2022Effective Knowledge Transfer Across Cities : The prediction\\nresults obtained from the CHI-taxi dataset validate the supe-\\nrior forecasting capabilities of our model in cross-city scenarios.\\nThis enhancement can be attributed to the integration of spatio-\\ntemporal encoders with the spatio-temporal instruction-tuning\\nparadigm. By incorporating these components, our model ef-\\nfectively captures universal and transferable spatio-temporal\\npatterns, allowing it to make accurate predictions. Additionally,\\nby considering different geographical information and temporal\\nfactors alongside the learned transferred knowledge, our model\\nsuccessfully associates spatio-temporal patterns exhibited by\\nsimilar functional areas and historical periods. This comprehen-\\nsive understanding provides valuable insights for making precise\\nzero-shot predictions in cross-city scenarios.\\n4.3 Classical Supervised Prediction Task (RQ2)\\nThis section examines the predictive capabilities of our UrbanGPT\\nin end-to-end supervised prediction scenarios, as presented in Ta-\\nble 2. We will discuss the results from two perspectives below.\\nEnhanced Long-Term Forecasting Abilities : We examined the\\nmodel\u2019s effectiveness in long-term spatio-temporal forecasting by\\nutilizing test datasets that spanned broader time intervals. For in-\\nstance, we trained the model using data from 2017 and evaluated its\\nperformance on data from 2021. The results of these experiments\\ndemonstrate that our UrbanGPT possesses a significant advantage\\nover the baselines, highlighting its superior ability to generalize\\nacross different temporal landscapes. This capability reduces the\\nneed for frequent retraining or incremental updates, making the\\nmodel more aligned with real-world applications. Additionally, the\\nexperiments have confirmed that incorporating additional textual\\nknowledge does not hinder model performance or introduce noise,\\nthus further validating the feasibility of utilizing large language\\nmodels to enhance spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.\\nSpatial Semantic Understanding : Accurately capturing spatial\\ncorrelations is crucial in the realm of spatio-temporal prediction.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 7\\n\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon23456 MAE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOurs\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon3456789101112131415 RMSE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOurs\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon12345 MAE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOurs\\n123456789101112\\nHorizon456789101112131415 RMSE on CHI-taxi\\nAGCRN\\nASTGCN\\nTGCN\\nMTGNNSTWA\\nSTGCN\\nDMVSTNET\\nOursFigure 4: Time step-based prediction comparison experiment conducted on the CHI-taxi dataset.\\nTable 2: Evaluation of performance in the end-to-end super-\\nvised setting on the NYC-taxi and NYC-bike datasets.\\nModelNYC-taxi NYC-bike\\nInflow Outflow Inflow Outflow\\nMAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE MAE RMSE\\nAGCRN 2.83 8.35 2.62 9.21 3.30 7.65 3.38 7.73\\nASTGCN 5.41 18.04 5.00 19.29 3.87 7.93 3.66 7.69\\nGWN 3.91 11.93 2.89 10.85 4.30 9.04 3.88 8.29\\nMTGNN 3.09 10.13 2.61 10.96 3.31 7.47 3.26 7.61\\nSTWA 3.90 12.64 3.15 11.32 4.23 9.07 4.18 9.18\\nSTSGCN 4.57 13.93 4.41 15.87 5.10 12.23 4.72 10.78\\nSTGCN 3.45 9.82 3.17 10.53 3.88 9.23 3.90 9.08\\nTGCN 3.99 11.47 3.31 11.58 4.12 7.92 4.11 7.84\\nDMVSTNET 3.83 11.55 2.76 9.88 3.71 7.95 3.69 7.92\\nST-LSTM 7.78 15.41 6.92 17.12 5.00 11.52 4.96 11.41\\nUrbanGPT 2.50 6.78 1.71 6.68 3.11 7.10 3.01 6.94\\nTraditional methods often employ graph networks or attention\\nmechanisms to analyze these correlations.

In contrast, our model com-\\npensates for the absence of explicit spatial encoders by integrating\\nextensive geographic and points of interest (POIs) data within the\\ntextual input. This approach enables the model to comprehend the\\nshared characteristics of areas with similar functions at a higher\\nsemantic level. Consequently, it deduces patterns of correlation\\nbetween various functional zones and effectively represents the\\ninterconnections among different regions.\\n4.4 Ablation study (RQ3)\\nThis section investigates the impact of different key components\\non the performance of our model, as illustrated in Figure 5. Our\\nrigorous testing primarily revolves around the zero-shot scenario\\nusing the NYC-taxi dataset. Through our analysis, we have distilled\\nthe benefits offered by the different modules into four key points.\\n\u2022(1) Impact of Spatial and Temporal Context :-STC . By re-\\nmoving time and spatial information from the instruction text,\\nwe observed a noticeable decline in the model\u2019s performance.\\nThis can be attributed to the lack of temporal information, forcing\\nthe model to rely solely on spatio-temporal encoders for encoding\\ntime-related features and performing prediction tasks. Furthermore,\\nthe absence of spatial information hindered the model\u2019s ability to\\ncapture spatial correlations, making it challenging to analyze the\\ndistinct spatio-temporal patterns of different areas.\\n\u2022(2) Impact of Instruction-Tuning with Diverse Datasets :-\\nMulti .

As a result, the model\u2019s per-\\nformance was suboptimal. By integrating diverse spatio-temporal\\ndata from multiple sources, our model can effectively capture the\\nunique characteristics of different geographical locations and their\\nevolving spatio-temporal patterns.\\n\u2022(3) Impact of Spatio-Temporal Encoder :-STE . In this vari-\\nant, we disable the spatio-temporal encoder to investigate its\\neffect on aligning the large language model with encoded urban\\ndependency dynamics into latent embedding space.\\nThe results clearly indicate that the absence of the spatio-temporal\\nencoder significantly hampers the performance of the large lan-\\nguage model in spatio-temporal prediction scenarios. This under-\\nscores the crucial role played by the proposed spatio-temporal\\nencoder in enhancing the model\u2019s predictive capabilities.\\n\u2022(4) Regression Layer Incorporation in Instruction-Tuning:\\nT2P. We explicitly instructed UrbanGPT to generate its predic-\\ntions in a textual format. However, the suboptimal performance\\nindicates the challenges in utilizing LLMs for precise numerical\\nregression tasks, as opposed to employing regression layers.\\nThe primary challenge stems from the model\u2019s dependence on\\nmulti-class loss for optimization during training, leading to a mis-\\nmatch between the model\u2019s probabilistic output and the continuous\\nvalue distribution necessary for spatio-temporal forecasting. To\\nbridge this gap, we incorporated a regression predictor into our\\nmodel, significantly improving its capacity to generate more precise\\nnumerical predictions for regression tasks.\\n4.5 Model Robustness Study (RQ4)\\nIn this section, we focus on evaluating the robustness of our Ur-\\nbanGPT across different spatio-temporal pattern scenarios.

However, the baseline model struggles in\\nregions with high variance, particularly within the (0.75, 1.0] range,\\nresulting in inaccurate predictions.

Deep spatio-temporal\\nprediction methods have gained prominence in deep learning due\\nto their impressive performance. These models typically consist of\\ntwo components: temporal dependency modeling and spatial corre-\\nlation encoding. Early models like D-LSTM [ 43] and ST-resnet [ 45]\\nused RNNs and convolutional networks to model temporal and\\nspatial dependencies. Graph neural networks (GNNs) proved to\\nbe a natural fit for spatial correlation modeling, as seen in models\\nlike STGCN [ 42] and DCRNN [ 14], which utilized graph structures\\nbased on node distances. Techniques such as learnable region-wise\\ngraph structures [ 36,37] and dynamic spatio-temporal graph net-\\nworks [9, 48] have further enhanced spatial correlation modeling.\\nFurthermore, researchers have explored approaches such as\\nmulti-scale temporal learning [ 34] and multi-granularity tempo-\\nral learning [ 8] to encode temporal dependencies. These strategies\\nenable the capture of features like long-term and short-term correla-\\ntions as well as periodicity. These advancements have significantlycontributed to the progress of spatio-temporal prediction. However,\\nit is worth noting that the majority of these studies are tailored\\nfor supervised contexts, with limited research and development\\nfocused on zero-shot spatio-temporal forecasting. This represents\\nan important area that requires further exploration.\\nSpatio-Temporal Pre-training . Spatio-temporal pre-training tech-\\nniques have recently received significant research attention. These\\ntechniques primarily focus on generative [ 16,24] and contrastive [ 46]\\npre-training models to enhance the predictive performance of down-\\nstream tasks. There has also been extensive exploration of pretrain-\\nfinetune frameworks for few-shot learning scenarios [ 13,19], aim-\\ning to improve knowledge transferability by aligning source and\\ntarget data. However, these approaches require training or fine-\\ntuning on target data and lack zero-shot prediction capabilities. In\\nthis work, we address the challenge of data scarcity in downstream\\nurban scenarios by proposing UrbanGPT. Our model demonstrates\\nthe ability to generalize well across various scenarios, mitigating\\nthe need for extensive training or fine-tuning on target data.\\nLarge Language Models. The emergence of large language mod-\\nels [3,21] has recently attracted significant attention due to their\\nunprecedented machine performance in tasks like text understand-\\ning and reasoning. These models have become a hot topic, demon-\\nstrating the potential to advance from intelligent algorithms to\\nartificial intelligence. Open-source large language models such as\\nLlama [ 28,29], Vicuna [ 50], and ChatGLM [ 44] have been released,\\nleading to researchers exploring their application in various fields\\nto enhance transfer learning capabilities with domain knowledge\\nfrom these models. In the computer vision domain, researchers\\nhave combined multimodal large language models with prompt\\nlearning methods to achieve zero-shot predictions in downstream\\ntasks [ 25,51,52]. Furthermore, the capabilities of LLMs in graph\\nreasoning [ 2,4,27], recommendation [ 10,23,35] and traffic anal-\\nysis [ 6] have been extensively studied. However, the utilization\\nof large language models for zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction\\ntasks in the field of urban intelligence remains largely unexplored.\\n6 CONCLUSION\\nWe present the UrbanGPT, a spatio-temporal large language model,\\nto generalize well in diverse urban scenarios. To seamlessly align\\nthe spatio-temporal contextual signals with LLMs, we introduce a\\nspatio-temporal instruction-tuning paradigm. This empowers the\\nUrbanGPT with the remarkable ability to learn universal and trans-\\nferable spatio-temporal patterns across various types of urban data.\\nThrough extensive experiments and meticulous ablation studies,\\nwe demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of the UrbanGPT\u2019s\\narchitecture and its key components. However, it is important to\\nacknowledge that while the results are promising, there are still\\nlimitations to be addressed in future studies. As a first step, we are\\nactively engaged in collecting a more diverse range of urban data\\nto enhance and refine the capabilities of our UrbanGPT across a\\nbroader spectrum of urban computing domains. Additionally, un-\\nderstanding the decision-making process of our UrbanGPT is of im-\\nportance. While the model demonstrates exceptional performance,\\nproviding interpretability and explainability is equally essential.\\nFuture research efforts will focus on empowering our model with\\nthe ability to interpret and explain its predictions.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 9\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n[1]Lei Bai, Lina Yao, Can Li, Xianzhi Wang, and Can Wang. 2020.

This includes detailed dataset informa-\\ntion, hyperparameter configuration, experimental setting for the\\ninstruction-tuning phase and test phase, as well as the baselines.\\nFurthermore, we present a case study of our UrbanGPT, showcasing\\nits effectiveness for zero-shot spatio-temporal predictions.\\nA.1 Experimental Details Description\\nA.1.1 Dataset Details. We collected data on taxi flows, bicycle\\nflows, and crime incidents in New York City for training and evalu-\\nation. The NYC-taxi dataset contains 263 regions, with each region\\nmeasuring approximately 3km x 3km. The time sampling inter-\\nval for this dataset is 30 minutes. The NYC-bike and NYC-crime\\ndatasets consist of 2162 regions, each represented by a 1km x 1km\\ngrid. The time sampling interval for NYC-bike is also 30 minutes,\\nwhile for NYC-crime, it is 1 day. All datasets cover the time period\\nfrom Jan 1, 2016, to Dec 31, 2021, in NYC. The CHI-taxi dataset\\nincludes 77 regions, with each region measuring approximately\\n4km x 4km. This dataset includes all taxi data from January 1, 2021,\\nto December 31, 2021, with a time sampling interval of 30 minutes.\\nA.1.2 Hyperparameters Settings. The parameters for the di-\\nlation convolution kernel in the time encoder are set as follows:\\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b,\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61, and\ud835\udc51\u2032\\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61are all set to 32, with a dilation factor of 1. For\\nour prediction task, we aim to predict the next 12 steps of data\\nbased on the previous 12 steps. Both the history length ( \ud835\udc3b) and\\nprediction length ( \ud835\udc43) are set to 12. The projection layer parameters\\nare configured with \ud835\udc51set to 64 and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3fset to 4096. Lastly, the hidden\\nlayer parameter \ud835\udc51\u2032for the regression layer is set to 128.\\nA.1.3 Further Experimental Setup Descriptions. During the\\ninstruction-tuning phase, we randomly selected 80 regions from\\nthe three datasets in New York City as training data. It\u2019s important\\nto note that the region indices were kept consistent for the NYC-\\nbike and NYC-crime datasets. The training sets had specific time\\nintervals: for NYC-taxi datasets, it ranged from January 1, 2017,\\nto March 31, 2017; for NYC-bike datasets, it covered April 1, 2017,\\nto June 30, 2017; and for NYC-crime datasets, it spanned from\\nJanuary 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018. For the pretraining of the\\nspatio-temporal dependency encoder and the baseline models, we\\nutilized the same data for training to optimize the parameters. The\\nmaximum epoch count was set at 100. In the testing phase, we\\nconducted the following evaluations:\\n\u2022(i)Zero-Shot Prediction . We also selected an additional 80\\nregions from the New York City datasets as unseen test data. For\\nthe NYC-bike and NYC-taxi datasets, we used the first two weeks\\nof data in 2020 for testing. As for the NYC-crime dataset, we used\\nthe entire year of 2020 for testing. In the case of the Chicago city\\ndataset, we evaluated the model using all the data from Dec 2021.\\n\u2022(ii)Classical Supervised Prediction : For evaluation purposes,\\nwe chose the data with the longest time interval, which involved\\ntesting the model using all the data from the NYC-bike and NYC-\\ntaxi datasets specifically for the month of December 2021.\\nA.1.4 Baseline Details. To facilitate our discussion, we have\\ncategorized all the baselines into three distinct categories: RNN-\\nbased models, attention-based models, and graph neural network(GNN)-based spatio-temporal prediction models. Below, we provide\\ndetailed descriptions of each baseline category:\\nRNN-based Spatio-Temporal Methods:\\n\u2022ST-LSTM [33]: It incorporates the Long Short-Term Memory to\\ncapture temporal dependencies in the spatio-temporal data.\\n\u2022AGCRN [1]: RNNs are employed to capture temporal correlations,\\nallowing for the representation of the evolving patterns over time.\\n\u2022DMVSTNET [39]: In this method, RNNs are utilized to effectively\\nmodel temporal dependencies, capturing the patterns that evolve\\nover time. Furthermore, convolutional networks and fully con-\\nnected layers are employed to capture local spatial correlations\\nand establish meaningful spatial relationships.\\nAttention-based Spatio-Temporal Approaches:\\n\u2022ASTGCN [8]: In this method, attention mechanisms are employed\\nto capture multi-granularity temporal correlation features.\\n\u2022STWA [5]: The model incorporates personalized temporal and\\nspatial parameters into the attention module, allowing for the\\nmodeling of dynamic spatio-temporal correlations.\\nSpatio-Temporal GNNs:\\n\u2022GWN [37]: It incorporates a learnable graph structure and 1-D\\nconvolutions to effectively learn spatio-temporal dependencies.\\n\u2022MTGNN [36]: It utilizes a learnable graph structure to model\\nmultivariate temporal correlations. MTGNN employs 1-D dilation\\nconvolutions to generate temporal representations.\\n\u2022TGCN [47]: This model combines graph neural networks (GNNs)\\nfor spatial correlation modeling and recurrent neural networks\\n(RNNs) for temporal correlation modeling.\\n\u2022STGCN [42]: It uses gated temporal convolutions and GNNs to\\nmodel temporal and spatial dependencies, respectively.\\n\u2022STSGCN [26]: It introduces a spatio-temporal graph construction\\nto learn spatial correlations across adjacent time steps.\\nA.2 Case study\\nIn this section, we assess the effectiveness of different large lan-\\nguage models (LLMs) in zero-shot spatio-temporal prediction sce-\\nnarios, as illustrated in Table 3 and Table 4. The instructions pro-\\nvided to the models are clearly indicated in blue font. The results\\ndemonstrate that various LLMs are capable of generating predic-\\ntions based on these instructions, thereby highlighting the effective-\\nness of the prompt design. For instance, ChatGPT relies on historical\\naverages rather than explicitly incorporating temporal or spatial\\ndata in its predictions. Llama-2-70b analyzes specific time periods\\nand regions, but it encounters challenges in encoding numerical\\ntime-series dependencies, resulting in suboptimal predictive perfor-\\nmance. On the other hand, Claude-2.1 effectively summarizes and\\nanalyzes historical data, leveraging peak-hour patterns and points\\nof interest to achieve more accurate traffic trend predictions.\\nOur proposed UrbanGPT seamlessly integrates spatio-temporal\\ncontextual signals with the reasoning capabilities of large language\\nmodels (LLMs) through a spatio-temporal instruction-tuning para-\\ndigm. This integration leads to remarkable improvements in predict-\\ning numerical values and spatio-temporal trends. These findings\\nunderscore the potential and effectiveness of our framework in\\ncapturing universal spatio-temporal patterns, making zero-shot\\nspatio-temporal prediction practical and achievable.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\n## Page 11\\n\\nTable 3: We examine the zero-shot predictions of different LLMs for bicycle flow in NYC with the provided instructions.\\nInstructions: Given the historical data for bike flow over 12 time steps in a specific region of New York City, the recorded bike inflows\\nare [12 8 9 15 10 12 14 9 6 12 25 20], and the recorded bike outflows are [5 12 12 15 10 11 6 9 4 6 10 15]. The recording time of the\\nhistorical data is \u2019January 14, 2020, 12:00, Tuesday to January 14, 2020, 17:30, Tuesday, with data points recorded at 30-minute intervals\u2019.\\nHere is the region information: This region is located within the Staten Island borough district and encompasses various POIs within a\\none-kilometer radius, covering Education Facility, Cultural Facility, Commercial, Transportation Facility categories. We now aim to\\npredict the bike inflow and outflow for the next 12 time steps during the time period of \u2019January 14, 2020, 18:00, Tuesday to January 14,\\n2020, 23:30, Tuesday, with data points recorded at 30-minute intervals\u2019. To improve prediction accuracy, a spatio-temporal model is\\nutilized to encode the historical bike data as tokens <ST_Start><ST_HIS><ST_HIS><ST_End>, where the first and the second tokens\\ncorrespond to the representations of bike inflow and outflow. Please conduct an analysis of the traffic patterns in this region, taking into\\naccount the provided time and regional information, and then generate the predictions (the predictive tokens for regression).\\nGround true: Based on the given information, the predictions of bike inflow and outflow in this region are [26 38 28 24 20 13 16 9 5 3\\n5 2] and[12 19 10 10 11 9 6 5 4 4 2 2] .\\nLlama-2-70b Responds: Based on the provided historical data, I have ...

Predicted Bike Outflow: [9.58 9.58... 9.58] ...\\nClaude-2.1 Responds: Based on the provided historical data, this region in Staten Island seems to experience fluctuating yet relatively\\nlow bike traffic flow during the daytime on Tuesdays. The bike inflows range from 6 to 15 per 30-minute interval, while outflows range\\nfrom 4 to 15.Given the region covers education, cultural, commercial, and transportation facilities within a 1km radius, the bike traffic\\nlikely corresponds to people traveling to and from these points of interest. The fluctuations could reflect class/work schedules and\\ntransportation needs throughout the day.For the evening prediction period of 6PM to 11:30PM, we may expect some further fluctuations\\nbut generally declining bike traffic as the day turns to night. People would be finishing up activities and heading home. I would predict\\nthe following bike inflows and outflows for the next 12 time steps: [10 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 1 1] and[8 6 5 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 1 1] ...\\nUrbanGPT Responds: Based on the given information, the predictions (predicted tokens) of bike inflow and outflow in this region are\\n<ST_PRE> [20 21 22 21 17 12 9 7 6 5 5 5] and <ST_PRE> [11 10 8 7 6 6 5 4 4 3 3 2] .\\nTable 4: Zero-shot predictions of different LLMs for taxi flow in NYC with the provided instructions (without spatial information).\\nInstructions: Given the historical data for taxi flow over 12 time steps in a specific region of New York City, the recorded taxi inflows\\nare [111 86 90 78 49 75 46 32 20 14 9 9], and the recorded taxi outflows are [100 91 58 39 47 47 19 22 21 9 16 10].

Predicted taxi outflows: [40.83 40.83... 40.83] ...\\nClaude-2.1 Responds: The data covers evening hours on a Sunday and early morning hours on a Monday. We can expect lower taxi\\ndemand during later Sunday evening, with some pickup around end-of-weekend times and early Monday commute times. The region\\nis unspecified, so we cannot infer any location-specific usage patterns. Inflow ranges from 49-111 taxis over the 30 minute intervals.\\nOutflow ranges from 19-100 taxis. This indicates the region likely serves both residential and commercial purposes.\\nPrediction: Inflows: [25 15 10 8 7 9 15 25 35 40 45 50] .
