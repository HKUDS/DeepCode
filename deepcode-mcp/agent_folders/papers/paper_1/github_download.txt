I'll help you download these GitHub repositories to the specified directory. First, let's create the target directory if it doesn't exist, and then download each repository.
[Calling tool filesystem_create_directory with args {'path': '/Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/agent_folders/papers/paper_1/code_base'}]
Now, I'll download each repository one by one:

1. LightGCN:
[Calling tool github-downloader_git_clone with args {'repo_url': 'https://github.com/kuandeng/LightGCN', 'target_path': '/Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/agent_folders/papers/paper_1/code_base/LightGCN'}]
2. Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering:
[Calling tool github-downloader_git_clone with args {'repo_url': 'https://github.com/xiangwang1223/neural_graph_collaborative_filtering', 'target_path': '/Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/agent_folders/papers/paper_1/code_base/NGCF'}]
3. GraphRec:
[Calling tool github-downloader_git_clone with args {'repo_url': 'https://github.com/wenqifan03/GraphRec-WWW19', 'target_path': '/Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/agent_folders/papers/paper_1/code_base/GraphRec'}]
4. MHCN:
[Calling tool github-downloader_git_clone with args {'repo_url': 'https://github.com/librahu/MHCN', 'target_path': '/Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/agent_folders/papers/paper_1/code_base/MHCN'}]
5. SGL:
[Calling tool github-downloader_git_clone with args {'repo_url': 'https://github.com/wujcan/SGL-Torch', 'target_path': '/Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/agent_folders/papers/paper_1/code_base/SGL'}]
Let me verify the downloaded repositories:
[Calling tool filesystem_list_directory with args {'path': '/Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/agent_folders/papers/paper_1/code_base'}]
I've successfully downloaded 4 out of the 5 repositories. The MHCN repository (https://github.com/librahu/MHCN) appears to be no longer available or has been moved. The other four repositories have been successfully cloned to their respective directories:

1. LightGCN - Successfully downloaded
2. NGCF (Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering) - Successfully downloaded
3. GraphRec - Successfully downloaded
4. MHCN - Failed (repository not found)
5. SGL - Successfully downloaded

Would you like me to try finding an alternative repository for MHCN or would you like to provide an alternative URL for it?
