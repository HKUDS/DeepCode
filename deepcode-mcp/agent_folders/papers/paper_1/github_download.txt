Let's proceed with downloading the verified GitHub repositories for the specified references and organize them accordingly under the given directory structure.

### Steps to Perform:
1. **Create directories** for each verified repository.
2. **Clone the repositories** to the newly created directories.
3. **Remove the `.git` directory** to save space.
4. **Create a `README.md` file** in each directory with relevant information.

### Base Directory Path:
- Base: `{paper_dir}/github_codes/`

Here's what we will accomplish for each verified repository:

#### Repositories to Download:
1. **LightGCN: Simplifying and Powering Graph Convolution Network for Recommendation**
   - **Reference Number**: 1
   - **GitHub URL**: https://github.com/kuandeng/LightGCN
   - **Directory**: `{paper_dir}/github_codes/1`

2. **Improving Graph Collaborative Filtering with Neighborhood-Enriched Contrastive Learning**
   - **Reference Number**: 3
   - **GitHub URL**: https://github.com/RUCAIBox/NCL
   - **Directory**: `{paper_dir}/github_codes/3`

Let's start by creating the directories for these repositories. I'll proceed with this step first and then coordinate the cloning process.
It looks like there's an issue with the provided base directory path. It appears the `{paper_dir}` part of the path hasn't been specified, resulting in an error when trying to create the directories. 

Could you please provide the full base directory path where these repositories should be saved, or let me know how you'd like to proceed?
