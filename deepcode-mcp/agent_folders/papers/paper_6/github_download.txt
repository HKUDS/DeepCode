I'll help you download these repositories to the specified directory. Let me download them one by one.

1. First, let's create the target directory:
[Calling tool filesystem_create_directory with args {'path': '/Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/agent_folders/papers/paper_6/code_base'}]
Now, let's download each repository:

1. LibCity:
[Calling tool github-downloader_download_github_repo with args {'instruction': 'Clone https://github.com/LibCity/Bigscity-LibCity to /Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/agent_folders/papers/paper_6/code_base/LibCity'}]
2. AGCRN:
[Calling tool github-downloader_download_github_repo with args {'instruction': 'Clone https://github.com/LeiBAI/AGCRN to /Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/agent_folders/papers/paper_6/code_base/AGCRN'}]
3. MTGNN:
[Calling tool github-downloader_download_github_repo with args {'instruction': 'Clone https://github.com/nnzhan/MTGNN to /Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/agent_folders/papers/paper_6/code_base/MTGNN'}]
4. STGCN:
[Calling tool github-downloader_download_github_repo with args {'instruction': 'Clone https://github.com/VeritasYin/STGCN_IJCAI-18 to /Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/agent_folders/papers/paper_6/code_base/STGCN'}]
5. T-GCN:
[Calling tool github-downloader_download_github_repo with args {'instruction': 'Clone https://github.com/lehaifeng/T-GCN to /Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/agent_folders/papers/paper_6/code_base/T-GCN'}]
Let's verify the directory structure:
[Calling tool filesystem_directory_tree with args {'path': '/Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/agent_folders/papers/paper_6/code_base'}]
All 5 repositories have been successfully downloaded to the specified directory. Each repository contains the implementation of their respective traffic prediction models:

1. LibCity - A comprehensive library for traffic prediction with multiple baseline models
2. AGCRN - Adaptive Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network
3. MTGNN - Multivariate Time Series Graph Neural Network
4. STGCN - Spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network
5. T-GCN - Temporal Graph Convolutional Network

The repositories are now ready for analysis and use. Each contains the complete source code, documentation, and example data (where applicable). Would you like me to provide more details about any specific repository or aspect of the downloaded code?
