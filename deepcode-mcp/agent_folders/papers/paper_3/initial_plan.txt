Implementation Plan

---

1. Project Overview

Scope and Objectives

- Implement RecDiff: a social recommendation model using hidden-space diffusion for robust graph denoising, as per the referenced paper.
- The system will preprocess user-item and user-user graphs, encode them with GCNs, perform latent-space denoising via diffusion (forward/reverse), fuse denoised and interaction embeddings, and optimize a composite loss (ranking + denoising).
- Provide an extensible, well-tested codebase suitable for research reproduction and practical ablation.

Key Challenges

- Stability of multi-step diffusion and reverse denoising in embedding space.
- Efficient and correct batch-wise GCN and diffusion computation.
- Ensuring correct index alignment across multiple graph/embedding spaces.
- Hyperparameter sensitivity (embedding size, diffusion steps, noise schedule).

Risk Mitigation

- Incremental testing (unit, integration) after each key module: GCN, forward diffusion, reverse denoising, fusion.
- Default hyperparameters set to paper values, with clear config override.
- Automated checks for divergence (NaNs, loss spikes).
- Clear error messages and recovery for mismatched input dimensions or graph structures.

5. Quality Standards

Coding Conventions

- PEP8 plus docstrings, type hints on all public APIs.
- Consistent naming: snake_case for files/variables, CamelCase for classes.
- Modular: Each key concept (GCN, diffusion, denoiser, etc.) in its own file/class.

Testing Requirements

- >95% code coverage on unit tests; edge cases (zero/degenerate graphs).
- Integration test from pipeline input to scorer.
- Random seed fix for reproducibility.

Documentation Standards

- API-level docstrings.
- Markdown docs: method descriptions, config explanations, result reproduction scripts.
- Sample Jupyter notebook for experiment replication.

Performance Targets

- Training time per epoch as per paper's Table 4.
- Parity or better performance (NDCG, Recall@K) on reference datasets vs. published results (within ±2% tolerance).
- Memory footprint: <12GB for med datasets; flag warning otherwise.

6. Execution Guidelines

Step-by-Step Implementation

1. Setup development environment, install dependencies.
2. Implement data loading; validate graph/data shapes.
3. Develop and unit-test GCN encoder.
4. Code and validate diffusion (forward), then denoiser MLP with timestep embedding.
5. Integrate GCN + diffusion + fusion; check forward pass end-to-end.
6. Add loss functions; construct training loop and confirm loss declines.
7. Implement inference loop; ensure outputs are comparable to paper metrics.
8. Write/validate comprehensive unit and integration tests.
9. Document code and API usage.
10. Tune hyperparameters for stability (batch size, betas, embedding size) as per dataset.

Integration Points

- Data loader must match indexing for GCN and denoiser inputs.
- Fusion and prediction layers interface with both clean and denoised embeddings.
- Loss/training must combine all objectives (weighted sums).
- Checkpointing at model, optimizer, and scheduler state.

Debugging Strategies

- Assert all tensor shapes at module boundaries.
- Print/log sample input/outputs for diffusion steps.
- Test loss and accuracy on toy/small graphs for sanity.
- Use try/except blocks for graph/data loading; validate before train.

Optimization Opportunities

- Precompute and cache diffusion schedules (alpha, alpha_bar).
- Sparse-GPU ops for large graph matrices.
- Mixed precision training for GPU acceleration.
- Profile major tensor ops, especially in GCN/diffusion modules.

This plan ensures a modular, reproducible, and maintainable implementation of RecDiff, closely matching the reference paper in both results and structure, and accommodates future extensions or ablations with minimal friction.
