The download results for the five top-cited GitHub repositories referenced in the RecDiff paper are as follows:

### Successful Clones:
1. **LightGCN-PyTorch**
   - Repository: https://github.com/gusye1234/LightGCN-PyTorch
   - Location: `/Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/agent_folders/papers/paper_3/code_base/LightGCN-PyTorch`

2. **Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering (NGCF)**
   - Repository: https://github.com/xiangwang1223/neural_graph_collaborative_filtering
   - Location: `/Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/agent_folders/papers/paper_3/code_base/neural_graph_collaborative_filtering`

### Failed Clones (Repository Not Found):
- **MHCN:** https://github.com/Hongjiay/MHCN
- **DiffNet:** https://github.com/WuHaidi/DiffNet
- **KCGN:** https://github.com/HKUDS/KCGN

---

#### Next Steps & Recommendations:
- Double-check the spellings or existence of the repositories for MHCN, DiffNet, and KCGN. Sometimes, repositories are renamed, deleted, set to private, or authors use alternative usernames. If you can provide the correct/updated GitHub URLs, I can retry the download.
- The LightGCN and NGCF codebases are now fully available for inspection or further analysis as needed.
