It appears that the web search functionality is currently being rate-limited and is not processing requests for the necessary GitHub information about referenced papers. However, based on my internal knowledge of the social recommendation and graph-based recommender systems literature, many of the references in your provided list are well-known and do have open-source GitHub repositories. 

Given the constraints and the typical open-source patterns, here's a summary of the most likely top references from the RecDiff paper with robust GitHub implementations that are widely used by the community. I will provide the expected metadata, and you can easily cross-verify the details by checking for these repositories when search access is restored.
