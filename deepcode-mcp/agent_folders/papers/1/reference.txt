I'll analyze the RICE paper to identify the 5 most relevant references with GitHub repositories. Let me start by examining the paper thoroughly.
[Calling tool brave_brave_web_search with args {'query': 'StateMask reinforcement learning explanation GitHub repository'}]
[Calling tool brave_brave_web_search with args {'query': 'Jump-Start Reinforcement Learning JSRL GitHub repository'}]

**Note: This analysis may be incomplete due to reaching the maximum number of tool usage iterations. To provide a more complete answer, I would have needed to:**
- Search for additional repositories mentioned in the references (e.g., CAGE Challenge, Tianshou, MuJoCo implementations)
- Verify GitHub repository statistics (stars, last updates, community activity)
- Examine more recent explanation methods and their implementations
- Search for repositories related to sparse reward environments and exploration methods

Based on my analysis of the RICE paper and the GitHub repositories I was able to identify, here are the 5 most relevant references with GitHub repositories:
