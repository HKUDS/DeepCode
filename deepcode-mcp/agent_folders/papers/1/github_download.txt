- **Relevance**: Core exploration method used in RICE's refining algorithm
- **Key Value**: Provides the intrinsic reward mechanism for exploration in sparse reward environments
- **Implementation**: Official OpenAI implementation with PyTorch

### 2. **StateMask** (`RL-state_mask/`)
- **Relevance**: Baseline explanation method that RICE builds upon
- **Key Value**: Shows how to identify critical states that contribute to training bottlenecks
- **Implementation**: Research implementation with mask network architecture

### 3. **OpenAI Baselines** (`openai-baselines/`)
- **Relevance**: Contains PPO implementation used in RICE for policy optimization
- **Key Value**: Provides stable optimization backbone for policy refinement
- **Implementation**: Reference implementations of multiple RL algorithms

### 4. **Stable Baselines3** (`stable-baselines3/`)
- **Relevance**: Modern, well-maintained RL library with PPO and other algorithms
- **Key Value**: Production-ready implementations for building upon RICE concepts
- **Implementation**: PyTorch-based with excellent documentation

### 5. **Go-Explore** (`go-explore/`)

```

These repositories provide you with:
- **Core exploration mechanisms** (RND, Go-Explore)
- **Explanation methods** (StateMask)
- **Stable RL implementations** (Baselines, SB3)
- **Foundation algorithms** (PPO implementations)

You can now analyze these codebases to better understand the components that RICE builds upon and potentially implement similar or improved methods.
