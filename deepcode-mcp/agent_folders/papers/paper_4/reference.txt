I'll analyze the paper's references to identify the most relevant 5 references with GitHub repositories based on the specified criteria. Let me search through the references and evaluate them.

First, let me search for available GitHub repositories mentioned in the references:
[Calling tool brave_brave_web_search with args {'query': 'github "LibCity: An Open Library for Traffic Prediction" Jingyuan Wang Jiawei Jiang'}]
Let me search for more repositories from other references:
[Calling tool brave_brave_web_search with args {'query': 'github "T-GCN: A Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Traffic Prediction" Ling Zhao'}]
Let me search for one more batch of repositories:
[Calling tool brave_brave_web_search with args {'query': 'github "MTGNN: Connecting the Dots: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Graph Neural Networks" Zonghan Wu'}]
Based on my analysis of the references and their GitHub repositories, here are the 5 most relevant references with GitHub implementations, ranked according to the specified criteria:
