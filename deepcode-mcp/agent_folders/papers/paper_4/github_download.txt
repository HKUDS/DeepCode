I'll help download these GitHub repositories. Let me download them one by one to the specified directory.

1. First, let's download LibCity:
[Calling tool github-downloader_git_clone with args {'repo_url': 'https://github.com/LibCity/Bigscity-LibCity', 'target_path': '/Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/agent_folders/papers/paper_4/code_base/LibCity'}]
2. Let's download T-GCN:
[Calling tool github-downloader_git_clone with args {'repo_url': 'https://github.com/lehaifeng/T-GCN', 'target_path': '/Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/agent_folders/papers/paper_4/code_base/T-GCN'}]
3. Now downloading MTGNN:
[Calling tool github-downloader_git_clone with args {'repo_url': 'https://github.com/nnzhan/MTGNN', 'target_path': '/Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/agent_folders/papers/paper_4/code_base/MTGNN'}]
4. Downloading AGCRN:
[Calling tool github-downloader_git_clone with args {'repo_url': 'https://github.com/LeiBAI/AGCRN', 'target_path': '/Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/agent_folders/papers/paper_4/code_base/AGCRN'}]
5. Finally, downloading STGCN:
[Calling tool github-downloader_git_clone with args {'repo_url': 'https://github.com/VeritasYin/STGCN_IJCAI-18', 'target_path': '/Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/agent_folders/papers/paper_4/code_base/STGCN'}]
Let's verify the downloaded repositories:
[Calling tool filesystem_list_directory with args {'path': '/Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/agent_folders/papers/paper_4/code_base'}]
All five repositories have been successfully downloaded to the specified directory. Each repository has been placed in its own subdirectory for clear organization. The repositories represent a good mix of foundational work (STGCN), comprehensive libraries (LibCity), and specialized implementations (T-GCN, MTGNN, AGCRN) in the field of traffic prediction and spatio-temporal modeling.

Would you like me to analyze any specific aspects of these codebases or provide more detailed information about any particular repository?
