   - Use first valid path/URL if multiple found
   - Treat as text input if no valid path/URL found

2. Path Type Classification:
   - URL (starts with http:// or https://): input_type = "url", path = "detected URL"

   - Directory path: input_type = "directory", path = "detected directory path"
   - No path/URL detected: input_type = "text", path = null

3. Requirements Analysis:
   - Extract ONLY requirements from additional_input
   - DO NOT modify or interpret requirements
