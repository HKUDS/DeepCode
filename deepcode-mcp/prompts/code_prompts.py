   - If multiple paths/URLs found, use the first valid one
   - If no valid path/URL found, treat as text input

2. Path Type Classification:
   - If input contains a URL (starts with http:// or https://):
     * input_type = "url"
     * path = "the detected URL"
   - If input contains a .pdf file path:
     * input_type = "file"
     * path = "the detected file path"
   - If input contains a directory path:
     * input_type = "directory"

3. Requirements Analysis:
   - Extract ONLY the requirements from additional_input
