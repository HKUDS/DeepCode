**Note: This analysis may be incomplete due to reaching the maximum number of tool usage iterations. To provide a more complete answer, I would have needed to:**
- Search for more references mentioned in the RICE paper (SAC, GAIL, StateMask, etc.)
- Analyze repository quality metrics (stars, maintenance, documentation)
- Verify implementation details and community adoption
- Cross-reference with Papers with Code for additional implementations

Based on the analysis conducted, here are the most relevant references with GitHub repositories:

**Key Findings:**
1. **Random Network Distillation** emerged as the most relevant reference, being directly integrated into RICE's core exploration mechanism
2. **Jump-Start Reinforcement Learning** provides the closest methodological comparison, with RICE improving upon its random frontier selection
3. **Proximal Policy Optimization** forms the algorithmic foundation that enables RICE's refinement guarantees

**Limitations of this analysis:**
- Could not analyze all referenced methods (SAC, GAIL, StateMask implementations)
- Repository metrics (exact star counts, recent activity) need verification
- Some implementations may exist in different repositories not discovered in initial search
- Quality assessments are based on limited repository exploration
