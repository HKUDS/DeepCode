Based on the concept and algorithm analyses provided, I'll create a detailed reproduction plan for the RICE (Refining Reinforcement Learning with Explanation) framework.

```yaml

    primary_algorithm:
      file: "src/core/rice.py"
      class: "RICEFramework"
      key_methods:
        - "explain_trajectory: Implements modified StateMask explanation"
        - "construct_mixed_distribution: Creates mixed initial state distribution"
        - "refine_policy: Main refinement loop with exploration bonuses"
    
    supporting_modules:
      - file: "src/models/mask_network.py"
        purpose: "StateMask explanation network implementation"
      - file: "src/models/rnd_network.py"
        purpose: "Random Network Distillation for exploration bonuses"
      - file: "src/utils/trajectory_utils.py"
        purpose: "Trajectory sampling and manipulation functions"
      - file: "src/utils/evaluation.py"
        purpose: "Fidelity evaluation metrics"
  
  dependencies:
    python_version: "3.8+"
    framework: "pytorch>=1.8.0"
    essential_packages:
      - "stable-baselines3"  # For MuJoCo environments
      - "mujoco-py"         # For robotics tasks
      - "numpy>=1.19.5"
      - "gym"               # For RL environments
    compute: "NVIDIA GPU with >=16GB memory (tested on A100)"
  
  implementation_phases:
    phase_1_core:
      - "Implement modified StateMask explanation method in src/models/mask_network.py"
      - "Create mixed state distribution sampler in src/core/rice.py"
      - "Set up RND exploration bonus computation"
      - "Implement main PPO-based refinement loop"
    
    phase_2_models:
      - "Build mask network architecture with simplified objective"
      - "Implement RND predictor and target networks"
      - "Create PPO training infrastructure"
      - "Add reward bonus mechanisms"
    
    phase_3_validation:
      - "Implement fidelity evaluation protocol"
      - "Create experiment runners for MuJoCo environments"
      - "Add baseline comparison infrastructure"
      - "Set up logging and visualization"
  
  experiments_to_run:
    - name: "MuJoCo Performance Comparison"
      script: "experiments/run_mujoco.py"
      expected_result: "Improved performance over PPO baseline"
    
    - name: "Explanation Fidelity Test"
      script: "experiments/evaluate_fidelity.py"
      validates: "Comparable fidelity to original StateMask"
    
    - name: "Ablation Studies"
      script: "experiments/ablation_study.py"
      validates: "Impact of mixed distribution and exploration"
  
  success_validation:
    metrics_to_match:
      - metric: "Task Performance"
        expected: "Higher than baseline PPO"
        tolerance: "±5%"
      - metric: "Explanation Fidelity"
        expected: "Comparable to StateMask"
        tolerance: "±10%"
    
    qualitative_checks:
      - "Verify critical state identification matches paper examples"
      - "Check exploration behavior around critical states"
      - "Confirm training bottleneck breakthrough"
    
  notes:
    missing_details:
      - "Exact architecture of mask network - use standard CNN/MLP based on environment"
      - "Specific PPO hyperparameters - use standard defaults from stable-baselines3"
    implementation_tips:
      - "Start with simpler MuJoCo environments for initial testing"
      - "Carefully tune reset probability p (0.25-0.5 range)"
      - "Monitor exploration bonus magnitude to avoid overshadowing task reward"
      - "Use environment-specific learning rates for PPO"
```

To organize the implementation, here's the file structure:

This reproduction plan captures all key components from both analyses:
1. The core RICE framework with its three main components (StateMask, mixed distribution, exploration-based refinement)
2. All necessary supporting infrastructure for training and evaluation
3. Clear validation strategy to verify reproduction success
4. Practical implementation phases that build up the system incrementally

The plan maintains the paper's essential contributions while providing concrete implementation details and structure.
