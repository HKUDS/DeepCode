MEND ranks highest due to its direct applicability to large language models and excellent implementation quality. The episodic memory and example forgetting papers provide crucial theoretical frameworks, while the continual learning papers offer complementary approaches for example selection and memory management. All repositories show active maintenance and good documentation, making them valuable for implementation.",

}

The selections were made based on:
1. Implementation relevance to the paper's core topics (model refinement, forgetting prevention)
2. Repository quality (stars, maintenance, documentation)
3. Technical alignment with the paper's methods
4. Community adoption and activity
5. Code quality and usability

I excluded the paper's official implementation as per constraints and focused on referenced works that provide reusable components for the described methods.
