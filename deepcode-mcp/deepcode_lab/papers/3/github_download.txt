I'll help download these 5 relevant GitHub repositories. Let me clone them one by one to the specified directory.

1. First, let me clone the MEND repository:
[Calling tool github-downloader_git_clone with args {'repo_url': 'https://github.com/eric-mitchell/mend', 'target_path': '/Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/deepcode_lab/papers/3/code_base/mend'}]
2. Next, let's clone the Episodic Lifelong Learning repository:
[Calling tool github-downloader_git_clone with args {'repo_url': 'https://github.com/h3lio5/episodic-lifelong-learning', 'target_path': '/Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/deepcode_lab/papers/3/code_base/episodic-lifelong-learning'}]
3. Let's clone the Example Forgetting repository:
[Calling tool github-downloader_git_clone with args {'repo_url': 'https://github.com/mtoneva/example_forgetting', 'target_path': '/Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/deepcode_lab/papers/3/code_base/example_forgetting'}]
4. Now for the Maximally Interfered Retrieval repository:
[Calling tool github-downloader_git_clone with args {'repo_url': 'https://github.com/optimass/Maximally_Interfered_Retrieval', 'target_path': '/Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/deepcode_lab/papers/3/code_base/Maximally_Interfered_Retrieval'}]
5. Finally, let's clone the Gradient Based Sample Selection repository:
[Calling tool github-downloader_git_clone with args {'repo_url': 'https://github.com/rahafaljundi/GradientBasedSampleSelection', 'target_path': '/Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/deepcode_lab/papers/3/code_base/GradientBasedSampleSelection'}]
I've successfully cloned 4 out of the 5 repositories. The last repository (GradientBasedSampleSelection) appears to be no longer available or may have been moved/renamed. The other four repositories have been successfully downloaded to the specified directory structure:

1. MEND
2. Episodic Lifelong Learning
3. Example Forgetting
4. Maximally Interfered Retrieval

Let me verify the directory structure:
[Calling tool filesystem_list_directory with args {'path': '/Users/lizongwei/Desktop/LLM_research/Code-Agent/deepcode-mcp/deepcode_lab/papers/3/code_base'}]
All four successful repositories are now available in the specified directory. Would you like me to try finding an alternative URL for the fifth repository (GradientBasedSampleSelection) or would you prefer to proceed with the four we have successfully downloaded?
