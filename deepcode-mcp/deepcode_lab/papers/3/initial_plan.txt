  # SECTION 9: Validation Checklist
  validation_checklist:
    model_architecture:
      - "[ ] Encoder produces correct output shapes"
      - "[ ] MLP properly initialized"
    training:
      - "[ ] Loss decreases during training"
      - "[ ] Batch sampling maintains pos/neg ratio"
    results:
      - "[ ] F1 scores exceed frequency baseline"
      - "[ ] Performance matches Table 1 within margin"
```

This plan provides a complete roadmap for reproducing the paper. Key implementation considerations:

1. The representation-based forecaster should be implemented first as it's more robust across models
2. Careful attention to caching logits and representations is crucial for efficiency
3. The encoder architecture requires proper initialization and careful learning rate tuning
4. Batch sampling needs to maintain the specified positive/negative example ratio
5. Evaluation should verify both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency

The plan should enable a developer to implement the complete system without referring back to the original paper.
